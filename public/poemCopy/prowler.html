<p aria-label="Epigraph" class='epigraph'><i>'Tis all a Chequer-board of Nights and Days<br />
Where Destiny with Men for Pieces plays:<br />
Hither and thither moves, and mates, and slays,<br />
And one by one back in the Closet lays.</i><br />

<div aria-label="Poem body">
	<p>I see you! I have no clue why you stand<br />
	more focused in my gaze, one of many<br />
	jackboot skins in their identikit threads &ndash;<br />
	your smile, perhaps? That angle of eyes<br />
	to nose to chin just one degree the better?<br />
	No time for questions as a tension starts<br />
	its slow build through my heels, my hip.</p>

	<p>I hunt by instinct: there's a lust in me<br />
	that can hammer weeds through concrete,<br />
	take a man by a thick of neck and shake<br />
	him to a torrent of shivers, pelt slicked<br />
	in sweats as a howl rips from his throat &hellip;</p>

	<p>I didn't choose this thing; all that I can ever be &ndash;<br />
	for good or ill, for hate or hope &ndash; was sealed<br />
	in my cells before my first astonished breath.</p>

	<p>I know how this ends, see, the way I tease<br />
	you from your mates when the bar shuts,<br />
	the lines you feed me as I coax your fool belief<br />
	that you are the alpha, I your toy for the time<br />
	that remains before the sun erupts. We have<br />
	necessities to cull, my unknown friend,<br />
	and my hunger burgeons beyond needs.</p>
