	<p>A river in flood, fast and deep and yet still &ndash; the base<br />
	boulders are too low to ripple this quiet sprint of water,<br />
	and there's no wind to tessellate its slate-cloud reflections.<br />
	Our steps should be smothered by a pitch of roars, but not here:<br />
	only the arch of my foot can tag the river's rumble, an ache<br />
	at the instep when I unboot and desock and let mud meet skin. </p>

	<p>I want you to know this. A camera can catch a mallard arsing<br />
	and diving beneath a driven, rooty log but what of the husp<br />
	caught in my throat as I watch? What technician's instrument<br />
	can hope to trap that moment when the swirl of distant starlings<br />
	merge with the first dance of evening midges around my head<br />
	and my eyes splice and perspectives collapse and still</p>

	<p>the river floods. No words. Instead, a setter at point, keen<br />
	to snout deadly waters to fetch the spinning bird, now bearded<br />
	in weeds, a braille of droplets running a soon-lost verse<br />
	across its wings. No words &ndash; until a sketch of fingers tap to<br />
	my palm, your hand gathering me back into me: <i>"Only an idiot<br />
	walks barefoot here: look at the litter and shit and stuff!"</i></p>
