<p>I buy a rose to mark<br />
our anniversary:<br />
stout, black thorns<br />
erupting through the stalk<br />
in whorls; the sawtooth leaves<br />
nestling the tight bud &mdash;<br />
sheets of peach and cream<br />
rolled in green folders.</p>

<p>You smile, take my palms<br />
and lag them round the stem,<br />
pluck a petal and press it<br />
inside my mouth with kisses:<br />
<i>'Love'</i>, you whisper, <i>'is what<br />
we do with symbols, yes?'</i><br />
I nod and grin, and bite<br />
the lips that feed me.</p>
