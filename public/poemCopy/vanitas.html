<p>If I grind the mirror to the flat<br />
of a millpond caught in a spring<br />
heatwave, still and un-rippled &mdash;<br />
can I keep what I have? Or must I</p>

<p>bend and swerve like a reed caught<br />
in the glove of an autumn storm,<br />
spent in the race to reach the sun &mdash;<br />
its taunting pull: tall and fine,</p>

<p>the pure line drawn from the muds<br />
of birth to the summer sky of dream,<br />
thrown down by the tick of a cloud &mdash;<br />
that moil of change? I've polished</p>

<p>this moment as keen as a betrothal<br />
to any lover and no blemish remains<br />
to offer me wintry lies, and still &mdash;<br />
it slips beyond me: water and light.</p>
