<div aria-label="Poem body">
	<p>Beyond the glassed face, fish<br />
	swim through mulm like ghosts<br />
	who haunt cellar barrels<br />
	sifting gassed yeast broth;</p>

	<p>I'll net you a drink, neck<br />
	the skin that sheens from nape<br />
	to blade, sift the hairs<br />
	weaving your back in whorls &ndash;</p>

	<p>and after? There is no after.<br />
	This face is glassed, the glass<br />
	is froth; ghost-white worms<br />
	sift mulm, feed fish, swim on.</p>
