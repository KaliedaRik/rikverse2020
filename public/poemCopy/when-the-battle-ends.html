<div aria-label="Poem body">
	<p>Look out of the window: see how<br />
	the sparrowhawk plucks feathers, how<br />
	the pigeon flaps grit over the path?</p>

	<p>I bought a brace of feathers once,<br />
	tied them to my arms and flapped &ndash;<br />
	elbows held acute above the shoulders.</p>

	<p>Look at you, crying. Why cry over<br />
	the carcass of a bird you've never loved?<br />
	You need new eyes to see beyond<br />
	the unzipped barbs along the quill.</p>
