	<p>Said the man to the key:<br />
	please be true for me.</p>

	<p>Said the key to the door:<br />
	creak for me once more.</p>

	<p>Said the door to the wall:<br />
	better catch his fall.</p>

	<p>Said the wall to the head:<br />
	I'll not be your bed.</p>

	<p>Said the head to the floor:<br />
	Never drink no more!</p>

	<p>Said the floor to the sick:<br />
	sticky; smelly; slick.</p>

	<p>Said the sick to the cheek:<br />
	rest in me a week.</p>

	<p>Said the cheek to the man:<br />
	please oh please just stand.</p>

	<p>Said the man to his legs:<br />
	&hellip; you're not my legs &hellip;</p>
