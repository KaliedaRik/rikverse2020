	<p>Moscow is jam-packed with watermelons.<br />
	All breathe free and unbounded.<br />
	And unbridled power blusters<br />
	from staccatto stall-criers.</p>

	<p>Awnings. Uproar. Scarved girls.<br />
	They laugh. They clatter their change.</p>

	<p>Knives and ace-high cuts.<br />
	Hey, Guv'nor, no worries!</p>

	<p>Who wants a watermelon?<br />
	It's verging to split! &ndash;<br />
	And so juicy and so tasty<br />
	And the militia's cap cloth<br />
	And the wall-stacked scooters.</p>

	<p>The September air is sharp to the tongue<br />
	And just as ringing as the melons.</p>

	<p>And so cheerful and homespun,<br />
	Like that watermelon at the gate,<br />
	The Earth wobbles<br />
	In a string-bag<br />
	Of meridians and latitudes.</p>
