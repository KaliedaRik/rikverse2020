<div aria-label="Poem body" data-form="Sonnet">
	<p>I see a bone of still-furled crocus, brave<br />
	against the tufts of winter wearied grass -<br />
	a lawn of shroud across Augustine's graves.<br />
	It juts too soon, for sure, for Candlemass</p>

	<p>has barely gone. But this is Hackney: here<br />
	the folks appreciate defiant shows<br />
	of cocksure grit. A single flower dares<br />
	to loft its petals, kiss the frost and grow</p>

	<p>beyond the long-dead skeletons so I<br />
	must best that challenge. I must cast away<br />
	the soft embrace of winter's mortal sigh,<br />
	its weave of tomb-deep ice that disarrays</p>
	
	<p>my joy of heat and hope and you and pain:<br />
	wear my summer shorts today in cold rain.</p>
