<div aria-label="Poem body">
	<p>In grey overalls, you are the greatest car <br />
	mechanic of all, fingers lubed in oil <br />
	as you tweak and tinker, fix and fine tune<br />
	village engines to precision in our yard. <br />
	Neighbours watch in awe as you restore the roar<br />
	and the purr to aged, upholstered frames. </p>

	<p>Early morning sees you leave your devotion <br />
	in the yard and choke your way to work, <br />
	moving fuel to garages across the county, road lord <br />
	in your yellow, six axle articulation, daring <br />
	the men of Kent to compete with you <br />
	in the only race that counts.</p>
