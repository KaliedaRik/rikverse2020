	<p>I adore this stinking town. So many ways<br />
	to die. Tonight a lady shot her pimp.<br />
	<i>"Didn't love me hard enough,"</i> she husked<br />
	when asked by a flashbulb jockey: <i>&hellip;why?</i></p>

	<p>There's beauty in trash: those shadows<br />
	of what was can snatch an ache of stories<br />
	from an un-holstered head. <i>"Didn't love me!"</i></p>

	<p>Her pimp is rich in coins; they clink and skit<br />
	across planks, sketch hearts in bloody lines<br />
	as he eases though my door, chest agape &ndash;<br />
	another type of love, he groans. Dead bills flap<br />
	as the corpse puddles to my desk: "Let's chat."</p>

	<p>We sit across split pine in a cracked room in a city<br />
	stacked at the end of time like party garbage.<br />
	"You're dead," I tell him. "Your case is closed."</p>

	<p>The man has sapphires for teeth. From the hole<br />
	in his chest he lifts his heart, its meat stopped:<br />
	"She broke this; she breaks it still. I need you<br />
	to find her, save her, keep her heart whole."</p>
