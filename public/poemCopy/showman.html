<p>I am wonderstruck by the way<br />
two people live within your eyes.</p>

<p>Neighbours adore you. Take your face<br />
for its value. Welcome your smile.</p>

<p>I keep my face guarded, my fear<br />
of your limits sharpened by years.</p>

<p>I learn to read you, your rages<br />
foretold by the level of blue</p>

<p>pills in your bottle &mdash; one taken<br />
each day to take the edge from you.</p>
