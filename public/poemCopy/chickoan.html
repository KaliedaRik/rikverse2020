	<p>I see the face of a neoglyph within a mirror's frame.<br />
	The face, it flickers between a father and a mother.<br />
	A hand can clap a slideshow between relatives. Each<br />
	tap of the cheek resolves to a new memory. Who<br />
	owns this face? Each morning I confront the face:<br />
	are you me? This morning I smell a char of feathers.<br />
	My brother is smoke, five years blown apart. Faces<br />
	lie. The face is not my brother. Tap ... tap. This face<br />
	I could love. I could cuddle its curves in the crook<br />
	of an arm, kiss its cool lips. Wear it out. Tap ... tap.</p>
