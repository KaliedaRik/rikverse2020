	<p>I see the face of a neoglyph within a mirror's frame.<br />
	The face, it flickers between a father and a mother.<br />
	A hand can clap a slideshow between relatives.<br />
	Each tap of the cheek resolves to a new memory.<br />
	Who owns this face? Each morning I confront that face:<br />
	are you me? Today's morning, I smell a char of feathers.<br />
	My brother is smoke &ndash; five years blown apart.<br />
	Faces lie. The face is not my brother. Tap ... tap.<br />
	This face I could love. I could cuddle its curves<br />
	in the crook of an arm, kiss its cool lips.<br />
	Wear it out. Tap ... tap.</p>
