<div aria-label="Poem body">
	<p>Fish scales blue as chop sea<br />
	scraped on tables, gut-knots<br />
	knocked to the sod for leery<br />
	dogs, cats, high white gulls.</p>

	<p>She smiles large as waves<br />
	caught on evening huffs<br />
	of breeze: <i>"You need good<br />
	macaroni pie go wid de cutter,<br />
	mister, put some flesh <br />
	on dose bones. Hah! No bounce<br />
	in you, skinny as de fish<br />
	in de bun like I make for you!"</i></p>

	<p>Gulls and dogs and shouts and wrong<br />
	words and cheap white chairs in dust<br />
	wet from washed trestles;<br />
	guts of drowned sun in the sea.</p>

	<p>And dark, so quick. A growl<br />
	of diesel, here, and here, here<br />
	and lights on lines round sheds.<br />
	<i>"You stay a while, skinny man<br />
	and we do some dancing, hah,<br />
	you de fish and me de cutter<br />
	catch your bones in my buns<br />
	wash down with good rum, yes?"</i></p>

	<p>Nets on poles shine in lights;<br />
	spouge plays on decks, wrong words<br />
	on old beats fresh-caught today;<br />
	spice grog with conch and lime.</p>
