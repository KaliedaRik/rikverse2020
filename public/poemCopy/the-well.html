	<p>It is as if it has no floor: <br />
	a coin could gracefully sway &ndash; left and right &ndash; <br />
	feathering its way through crystal layers, <br />
	past the mouth down and down, <br />
	tumbling to the heart of abyss. <br />
	Somewhere in the caverns <br />
	a power sleeps <br />
	that on occasions grants wishes <br />
	&ndash; one &ndash; two &ndash; three &ndash; <br />
	to those who would believe.</p>

	<p>Other days, other objects <br />
	travelled the length of stone and rock. <br />
	Swords and knives severed their paths <br />
	with dappled shadows down. <br />
	Combs and mirrors, gilt brooches: <br />
	iron in guises un-guessed. <br />
	Bone, carved with care, programmed <br />
	to please the healing spring, some <br />
	animal. Some not. </p>

	<p>It stands, as ever, bush guarded. <br />
	An iron grille covers the maw. <br />
	Pumps tap the clean spring, magic <br />
	the clear water away to the city <br />
	behind the hill. Undisturbed <br />
	it can slumber, unused <br />
	it can gather legends <br />
	of old mists and heroes, <br />
	and only my coin <br />
	disturbs the peace <br />
	of the well.</p>
