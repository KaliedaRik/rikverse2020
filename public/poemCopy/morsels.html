<p>When I fed you I set you three courses:<br />
oysters from Whitstable, a carnival<br />
of slime singed with lemon, edged<br />
from ashtray shells and gulped;<br />
a testicle of truffle, shaved<br />
into a soft scramble of eggs and cream<br />
and served on toast &ndash; crumbs knocked<br />
from your chin by my thumb, each morsel<br />
followed by a froth of champagne;<br />
figs stuffed with mole, the bitter<br />
chocolate squeezed from the fruit<br />
as you bit the sweet flesh.</p>

<p>When we fed guests you set me:<br />
rings of calamari around a candle<br />
guttering its wax into my navel;<br />
frets of watercress stems woven<br />
through the down between the hooks<br />
of my hips, dripping from the rinse;<br />
a Pharaoh's necklace &ndash; layers of mango<br />
intersliced with pear flesh, moulded<br />
to the folds of muscle and fat<br />
and bone lacing my heart within<br />
its cavity, safe from the scavengers<br />
snuffling through our home.</p>
