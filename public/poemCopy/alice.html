<p>She can see faces of loves and lovers<br />
within smattered stains on the wall:<br />
memory crowds a parched, delicate face  <br />
with fallow, dark furrows.<br />
She smells of her grandma sat in the room,<br />
eyes recognising visions &ndash; greeting what<br />
is not there: she knows They lie.<br />
She carries her youth well.<br />
They lie when They feed her, spoon to mouth:<br />
she tastes better food on her tongue.<br />
The lie when They wash her, evacuate her:<br />
she knows gentler hands caress her.</p>

<p>Alice sits in her room: a chair, a bed,<br />
four walls and a door. She does not speak:<br />
there are no more words to say.</p>
