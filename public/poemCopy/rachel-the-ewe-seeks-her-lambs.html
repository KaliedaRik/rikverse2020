<div aria-label="Poem body">
	<p>She has the prim hips of one<br />
	who makes her own bread daily;<br />
	her sockets are fresh petals<br />
	around a brined curl of pearl.</p>

	<p class='strophe-indented-with-italics'>"A husband's curse is a heavy burden:<br />
	it weighs on the womb like idols."</p>

	<p>She keeps a goat-wool scarf tied<br />
	taut across the brow as I pour<br />
	whisky as blended as incests &ndash;<br />
	she refuses with a smile to tempt<br />
	an offer of long labour, gratis.</p>

	<p class='strophe-indented-with-italics'>"I lost sight of him on the Efrat road;<br />
	a good man, worthy of sororital love."</p>

	<p>Her white glance speaks of tombs<br />
	and dust, birth-killed bones lost<br />
	between steads; her sumac breath<br />
	shows a devotion for hearths.</p>

	<p class='strophe-indented-with-italics'>"He took my miracles, my desert fruits &ndash;<br />
	Atonement comes, and I must hug them."</p>
