	<p>I wake to find a ladybird trundling <br />
	across my arm. Another trots the length<br />
	of a finger laid straight on the blanket, <br />
	hunting greenfly. More cascade from my hair <br />
	when I shake my head, a red hail bouncing<br />
	onto the hard, tan lawn. Beetles <br />
	are everywhere, blood-glazed shells <br />
	spotting yellow piss on mum's laundered <br />
	white bedsheets hanging on the line.<br />
	This everlasting summer is baking change </p>

	<p>into every leaf and crack. You've changed.<br />
	As if planting gran in the ground last spring<br />
	has set new sap seeping through your veins:<br />
	hair creeping past your collar, sideburns spreading<br />
	across your cheeks. You work on a friend's car<br />
	wearing a string vest and fresh gold chains.<br />
	I turn the volume down on anarchy &ndash; punk rockers<br />
	spitting through my radio, and see you've grown <br />
	four inches: another pair of wedge soles, cream<br />
	against grey overalls dotted with oiled, dying bugs.</p>

	<p>I relax back on my front, arse to the sky, tanning<br />
	a line for fashion. I don't want to move. New<br />
	uniform for a new school. New music, shouting<br />
	into my blood: kick it up, smash it out. Fuck, I've<br />
	got down tufts sprouting where yours are bleached,<br />
	like a fungus erupting over my puckered skin. Soon<br />
	I'll be bald like you, wrinkled like you. Cooked<br />
	by this bastard summer into you and I hate it.<br />
	Toss you! Burn my hide red, with black hair swirls<br />
	and piss the sheets yellow in a dream.</p>
