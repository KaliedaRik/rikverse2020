<p class="epigraph">(After Federico García Lorca's <a href="https://es.wikisource.org/wiki/%C2%A1Ay_voz_secreta_del_amor_oscuro!">¡Ay voz secreta del amor oscuro!</a>)</p>

<p>You, there! Secret voice of dark-held love!<br />
Yes you, bleating without wool! You wound!<br />
You gall needle, sunk camellia!<br />
You sea-less current, wall-stripped city!</p>

<p>Unbound night with your certain profile;<br />
God's Own mountain erect with anguish!<br />
You! Dog in my heart, molested voice;<br />
unconfined silence, swollen lily!</p>

<p>Run fast from me, you scald of iced voice;<br />
don't you lose me in brackens and briars<br />
where fruitless they groan &ndash; that sky, that flesh.</p>

<p>Let me leave this solid head of bone,<br />
give me a mercy, help break my grief!<br />
For I am love; for I am all life!</p>
