<p aria-label="Epigraph" class="epigraph">(After Federico Garc√≠a Lorca's <a href="https://es.wikisource.org/wiki/Soneto_de_la_dulce_queja">Soneto de la dulce queja</a>)</p>

<div aria-label="Poem body" data-form="Unrhymed sonnet">
	<p>I have a fear: a loss of wonder glimpsed &ndash;<br />
	that stare, your marbled eyes, and that light tick<br />
	your breath at night on my cheek &ndash; touch and touch <br />
	a single rose brushed in the breeze of sleep.</p>

	<p>I hold a sorrow: stuck upon this shore<br />
	a twist of trunk, my branches polled &ndash; yet most<br />
	I have no bloom, no bark or heart or soil<br />
	to feed the grubs that feed the pain I shine.</p>

	<p>If you alone remain my hidden jewel,<br />
	if you're my torture cross, my sweet-sprung hurt &ndash;<br />
	if I am but a dog at your command,</p>

	<p>never let me lose this thing that I've gained<br />
	and decorate your river's deepest flow<br />
	with a sheen of leaves dropped in my lost fall.</p>
