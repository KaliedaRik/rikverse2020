<div aria-label="Poem body">
	<p>Each evening, when we tell our day over dinner,<br />
	you reveal a new bruise &ndash; here the weal of a grip<br />
	so tight it bracelets your wrist entire; there<br />
	a kicked shin, a train-wreck scratch on the arm.<br />
	A rose of ovals tacked mid-chest tally a fight<br />
	taken to knuckles amid a gale of cuss words.</p>

	<p>I love that you smile as you spin your epics<br />
	of tiny victories &ndash; that bone-and-joints man<br />
	who drew strength from your flesh to stand<br />
	and walk to his food; the tiny woman adrift<br />
	in hostile memories who found your eye<br />
	and joined you in song. As we settle and eat</p>

	<p>I watch you in glances and know: the well<br />
	of care sprung from your core is too deep!<br />
	You have no choice but to see each new face<br />
	as a friend waiting to hatch, to smithy tears<br />
	to jewels and worry smiles from scowls &ndash; even<br />
	mine &ndash; and I adore you for it beyond wounds.</p>
