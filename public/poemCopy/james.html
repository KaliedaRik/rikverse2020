<p>James watches the monkey organ-chained.<br />
It huddles askance and will not look:<br />
the whites of its eyes avoid the crowds,<br />
and the crowds claim James and the monkey<br />
is gone.</p>

<p>And James is funneled through canvas tunnels.<br />
Crowds scramble to counters of baubles and jewels<br />
where hawkers and dealers line the sides<br />
screaming their wares, beckoning James<br />
to finger the goods, catching his ears<br />
with prices and bargains James cannot afford,<br />
then to throw him away, garbage,<br />
thrusting his presence from their tresles,<br />
their caustic rebukes stinging his sockets, flaming<br />
his eyes &ndash;</p>

<p>and James is lost:<br />
he lowers his head down to<br />
his shoulders and sits in a<br />
mire of legs and boots and dirt and<br />
heels, eyewhites straining away and<br />
ears handshacked, with a<br />
shivering chin tapping<br />
patellas and whispering in<br />
silence: <i>go away</i></p>

<p><i>go away</i></p>
