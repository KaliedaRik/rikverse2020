<p class="paragraph">Like all happy things, my commissions come in threes. Who am I to complain? The first, the pimp, pays in stones from his jaw. They are good stones, not glass; if I knew a straight pawnbroker I could pay some rent - but hey?</p>

<p class="paragraph">"You should settle your liquor bill first," says Anj, she of the dark eyes and the darker lusts. I should pay her first - I can read the woman like a ripped-off pulp - but I need her to ask, beg me for back wages. Angels have to learn about tempers before they lose them, and my guardian ain't too quick to pick up the particulars of human failures. That lady's fallen, for sure, but not far enough. Not yet.</p>

<p class="paragraph">If this were a story Anj would sit outside my office door, keen to insult all who pass her mouth, her cusses reminding the world of the sins of small-time capitalists living the dream of private investigations. My place would be behind a desk piled with half-abandoned cases of men who cheat their girls swirled on the romance of roses and vows. Maybe a missing dog to track down to the pound to keep me in loose change. There would be a bottle of rye in my bottom draw. There would be a lost partner whose space opposite me could bleach my bones in pities and guilts. There would be a girlfriend tucked away somewhere, or an ex-girlfriend or - let's be honest here - a bum chum of the 'close companion' type to keep a flame for my lost morals. </p>

<p class="paragraph">Fuck that for a set-up.</p>

<p class="paragraph">The liquor ain't negotiable. Hey! It's the End Times - the news-sheets say it daily so it's gotta be true - and I lost my trick pelvis a while back; if you can't kiss your ass goodbye you might as well wrap your lips around something useful!</p>

<p class="paragraph">My second commission's a lost cat. Now there's a story to tell ...</p>
