<div aria-label="Poem body">
	<p>We've assembled a new dream for you,<br />
	as per spec, with added colours<br />
	enamelled on the spelter frame.</p>

	<p>The cellar is fresh-hewn, with frets<br />
	of lime for the dangling of drops:<br />
	that pool of neuroses comes gratis.</p>

	<p>We can supply extra veneers<br />
	of your deity of choice at cost,<br />
	and laminate the clouds with eyes.</p>

	<p>For maximum pleasure, the fancy<br />
	should be applied with even strokes<br />
	and allowed to leaven in sweat.</p>

	<p>Remember, there's no shame in nudity,<br />
	not in your head; these strangers<br />
	who stare and chase are bespoke.</p>

	<p>We thank you for your custom. Please<br />
	dispose of your delusions carefully<br />
	after use. Consume before midsummer.</p>
