<p class='ml-6 italic'>(After: 2 September 2015)</p>

<p>A parade of waves renders pale fat, salty <br />
spatulas to paddle and turn his form as<br />
the sun heats and bleaches skin. A round</p>

<p>of gut-trapped gas crushes a fish caught<br />
in the folds of his cotton shirt. Nails,<br />
mother-trimmed, pearl and soften as</p>

<p>jelly combs tangle his hair; soon they wear<br />
grit as he beaches, a message in red<br />
that spells in angled limbs: enough!</p>
