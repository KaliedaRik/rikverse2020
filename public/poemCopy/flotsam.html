<div aria-label="Poem body">
	<p>A parade of waves renders pale fat, salty <br />
	spatulas to paddle and turn his form as<br />
	the sun heats and bleaches skin. A round</p>

	<p>of gut-trapped gas crushes a fish caught<br />
	in the folds of his cotton shirt. Nails,<br />
	mother-trimmed, pearl and soften as</p>

	<p>jelly combs tangle his hair; soon they wear<br />
	grit as he beaches, a message in red<br />
	that spells in angled limbs: enough!</p>
