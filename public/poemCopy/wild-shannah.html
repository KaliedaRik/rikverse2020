<p>She would mock the betrayal of the storm <br />
and scream her laughs as the clouds were torn, <br />
then race barefoot through fat, pendant corn <br />
when the skies began to cry. <br />
Great gobbets of rain would batter her skin <br />
as she taunted the gods of the storm to sing, <br />
then to tire of her sport and free the late sun <br />
to caress her wild hair dry.</p>

<p>Sunset. He was caught walking the hills <br />
by Shannah the fey, as the breezes fell still: <br />
she took up her hand, he gave her his will &ndash; <br />
absolving desires in his mind. <br />
She led him down past the clattering stream <br />
to the tumbled stones where the earth powers dream, <br />
once there to take him with an ancient ease: <br />
to bind him with eyes that shined. </p>

<p>The lammas moon wove a glamour-spell <br />
through the ribbon-drift mists of the night, <br />
and the wind-shattered rocks hummed a subtle earth song: <br />
granite might. <br />
Though he struggled to match the crystal-vein beat <br />
that pulsed with the fires in her eyes, <br />
all he managed to catch were lips open to greet <br />
his soft cries &hellip; </p>

<p>He woke to a caress of mist on his face <br />
within a circle of stone, granite in grace. <br />
He knew without thought the name of that place: <br />
Wild Shannah. <br />
Uncertain of how he came to be there, <br />
he day-gazed hushed stories of witches foul-fair <br />
&ndash; and caught remnants of music, deep in the air <br />
unremembered.</p>
