<p class='ml-6 italic text-sm'>(This being a True Account of an Occurrence taking place on the Second Floor of No. 1, Horse Guards Road, in the Offices above the Chancellor's Suite, working Necessarily Late one Evening in the Month of March, 2006)</p>

<p class='mb-0'>It takes a squint to glimpse him:</p>
<p class='ml-24'>don't look &mdash;</p>

<p>he's there! A man <br />
who stares across the room,<br />
stippled from his rightful time, </p>

<p>bemused by desks and wide glass <br />
panes, woodless screens, sootless lights<br />
that make his inky fingers glow. </p>

<p>I see him frown beneath <br />
his tattered wig, a blot of mud <br />
or shit still wet around his calf. </p>

<p>Why is he here? His arm<br />
curls around rolled parchments,<br />
wound in cotton ribbons. </p>

<p>When I twitch my head <br />
a touch, he starts, returns the glance.<br />
<i>See us</i>, his eyebrows arch, </p>

<p><i>both lost within <br />
this Treasury, too poor <br />
to seek escape</i>.</p>
