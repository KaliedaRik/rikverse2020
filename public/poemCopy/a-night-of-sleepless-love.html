<p aria-label="Epigraph" class="epigraph">(After Federico Garc√≠a Lorca's <a href="https://es.wikisource.org/wiki/Noche_del_amor_insomne">Noche del amor insomne</a>)</p>

<p>That night and us aloft with the full moon:<br />
it brought me to tears; to you it raised laughs.<br />
Your scorn seemed Godlike, while my grievances<br />
no more than small splinters and doves in chains.</p>

<p>That night and us beneath. Crystal sorrow<br />
brought you to tears for such deep distances.<br />
My anguish formed a harsh cluster of pains<br />
around your weak and sand embedded heart.</p>

<p>The dawn drew us together to the bed,<br />
our mouths set as one to the frozen stream<br />
of a wound without end that pours, that spills.</p>

<p>And the sun broke the shuttered balcony<br />
and the living coral spread wide its fan<br />
around my cold and shroud embedded heart.</p>
