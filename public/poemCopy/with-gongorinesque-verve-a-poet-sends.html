<p aria-label="Epigraph" class="epigraph">(After Federico Garc√≠a Lorca's <a href="https://es.wikisource.org/wiki/Soneto_gongorino_en_que_el_poeta_manda_a_su_amor_una_paloma">Soneto gongorino en que el poeta manda a su amor una paloma</a>)</p>

<p>This young Turian dove I send to you,<br />
with sweet bright eyes and plumes so pale and full,<br />
over the noble laurel pours and adds<br />
a slow and loving flame to where I stay.</p>

<p>Its candid virtue, its throat of soft down,<br />
presents a swirl of caught and heated foams<br />
with a trembled frost, pearl and shades of mist &ndash;<br />
it seeks to mark an absent mouth: your mouth.</p>

<p>Now pass your hands across its full white space<br />
and you will see flurries of song-spun snow &ndash;<br />
it settles on your elegance in flakes.</p>

<p>And thus my heart now caught by night and day<br />
and jailed within these walls of dark-held love<br />
must weep its harsh distress, not seeing you.</p>
