<p class="paragraph">Some nights I daydream of a life beyond the City. I have memories, a few of them true &ndash; or as honest as a half-sober mind can make them. There was a time before the End Times, know.</p>

<p class="paragraph">They remind me of paintings, those dreams, a cracked cere smeared over smiles and snarls. <i>Has a painter ever captured the cramp of an empty belly?</i> I asked Anj, once. She shrugged me an answer &ndash; it was one of those days she was done talking to me: a good day, that one, which ended in a settled bill from a grateful wife with a vindiction to complete.</p>

<p class="paragraph">Beyond the City the land is a crack of dirts and skeletons steeped in a drought of lost promises. Those who were once there lived amid the gaze of a harsh sun in the pomp of its endless summer; too hot to sleep, us kids would daze our way from shade to twilight, one missed hop-skip-step from clinker melanomas.</p>

<p class="paragraph">Yeah ... good times.</p>

<p class="paragraph">"You gonna work the Lady's case? She's paid an advance." Anj has ice in her water; the chips rattle in the tumbler like ten dollar tokens on the bones table. "It's religious," I say. She smirks: "The dame must be desperate to bring it to you."</p>

<p class="paragraph">What can I do, but agree?</p>

<p class="paragraph">All of the world is this City, now. Every love's sigh a breeze through detritus, every tear a salt slick in another shot of tequila. Our City is a place where diamonds are cheaper than a slice of lime, where wine skims through sump oil and the best place to find ice is in the chest of a dead CEO.</p>

<p class="paragraph">"I love this City," I tell Anj. She smiles, teases my brow with a wipe of cold glass as she reaches into my pocket to liberate her wage.</p>
