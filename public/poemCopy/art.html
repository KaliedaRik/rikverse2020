<p>It was speeded and slowed:</p>

<p>I had left the station, imitating vacancy<br />
as I brazened my way to the street bazaar,<br />
passing the morning muster of vagrants.</p>

<p>There was one, possibly young, laughing.<br />
The mouth was slit taut, lips slabbed by teeth<br />
as uneven as the paving I crossed.<br />
He gambolled his way into the road,<br />
vehicles screaming annoyance,<br />
their dominion challenged.</p>

<p class='strophe-indented-with-italics'>Hawkers distract me, smells<br />
of the bazaar tapping an anticipation&hellip;</p>

<p>Right is more interested in other things:<br />
Liechtenstein, is Right's first remark &ndash;<br />
then comments on continuing lines, forms<br />
of brush strokes. WHAMM! Dot dot.<br />
Seconds stall past before Left sees<br />
the object of Right's observation<br />
semi-circled by open mouths, hammered<br />
into the warming tarmac. Warhol<br />
is too obvious a conclusion &ndash; Right adds.</p>

<p>Left cannot agree. Left's vision casts a different scene.<br />
In the manner of a passionate Van Gogh.<br />
A desperate arrangement of offal<br />
spun across the canvas. Reddened sun-slants<br />
digging, dragging rays across bleached corn.<br />
Rags and boots hinting at distant structures<br />
to a foreground glory &ndash; and congealing clouds<br />
promising a shepherd's warning<br />
as I walk on.</p>
