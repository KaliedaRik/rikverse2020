<div aria-label="Poem body">
	<p>Uri slides motionless across the curve of the skies,<br />
	eyeless, checking niches and ledges<br />
	within balustrades of uncapped lintel<br />
	steepling from plains of choking sands,<br />
	aching to reach his fingers.</p>

	<p>He descends.<br />
	Trailing rainbows, he swathes<br />
	through shoals of angels and butterflies<br />
	and floats in the maw of a cavern cathedral<br />
	besieged by urchins driven<br />
	from deserts beyond to graze<br />
	the swaying alters of his Eden.</p>

	<p>Taking a spear of latexed steel<br />
	Uri impales the aliens, cracking shells:<br />
	rending flesh to the salt-current whim<br />
	until the last urchin spine drifts across<br />
	the coral floor and his starving lungs burn.<br />
	Uri clambers liquid ladders back to the skies<br />
	&ndash; leaving parrots and angels to feed on detritus<br />
	with butterflies and morays and dog sharks<br />
	and crabs.</p>

	<p>Breaking the wave-dome, Uri pushes his mask<br />
	to the top of his head and gasps air through teeth,<br />
	tastes the salt in the breeze.</p>
