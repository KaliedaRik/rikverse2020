	<p>I start with the lights. Good friends I've loved,<br />
	they start with the tree &ndash; sought and bought with bristles<br />
	and cones, balanced on a stand in the front room. Heirloom<br />
	baubles then mixed with glitter and gauzes, chocolates<br />
	and candlelights, each layer added as a conversation, <br />
	their story wrapping christmas fresh for the year. No,</p>

	<p>I start with the lights, check each bulb in its socket<br />
	before I wind them round my plastic spruce, settle the plug, <br />
	switch the show on. I pause with each snowy card received: <br />
	a smile for the decoded signature; changed addresses noted<br />
	in my dieting address book, shedding its leaves. Then I tack<br />
	holly and mistletoe to my front door, a dozen<br />
	sticky berries to greet the unknown year.</p>
