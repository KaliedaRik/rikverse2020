<p><i>"There are many different ways to be a man,"</i><br />
she said, <i>"and ten thousand tricks to falling<br />
in love."</i> Oh my sweet, I need to count them all,<br />
here, now, and let them cleave this time<br />
to countless, endless moments. What caught me first &ndash;<br />
a laugh to etch a web of cracks in diamond?<br />
A glance to snatch my eye wide? A tightened<br />
sinew caught across your neck? A gust<br />
of pit sweat, that snort, your tap of fingers<br />
on my drum-tight chest, a lip mid-bite &ndash;<br />
I topple into love with everything<br />
you do, demon infection who strikes and lingers,<br />
who plays my blood like a deep-note cello: smite<br />
me yesterday, tomorrow! You make me sing!</p>
