<p>Davey wants to swim.<br />
He will dive deep within the blue-tint dome.<br />
His arms will thrust him between the broken wracks.<br />
With huge downstrokes he will fly<br />
over the heaving emerald fields<br />
that emboss the golden-grit hills.</p>

<p>Davey dreams of such endeavours<br />
as he sits strapped to his chair,<br />
watching the wavelets dance within<br />
the chrome spokes of his wheels &ndash;</p>

<p>but it is not to be.</p>

<p>He cannot power his plague-broken body<br />
to slice one last time in freedom<br />
through the curtains of dancing shadows<br />
before him. It is not permitted<br />
for Davey to taste again the salt-freedom<br />
of escape far from his padded mobile home.</p>

<p>Such pleasures could hurt Davey.</p>

<p>Instead he has a compromise.<br />
Davey can wheel across the beach<br />
and dabble his bare, unnerved feet<br />
at the edge of the sea &ndash; and dream.</p>

<p>And when he is finished, his feet<br />
- and his wheels &ndash;<br />
will be quickly disinfected and dried,<br />
and he will be carefully guided<br />
past the high tide ridges<br />
of broken drums, oiled carcasses<br />
and un-rotting packaging;<br />
regurgitated by a poisoned realm<br />
that Davey would make his own.</p>
