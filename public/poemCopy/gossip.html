<p>I heard your news. A quarrel of tits<br />
clamp claws around the sprung twigs<br />
of the sycamore &mdash; huffs of warm air<br />
have cracked its buds; so pale,<br />
these new leaves, as they stretch.<br />
The sun plays catch-me with the clouds,<br />
a roil of damp shadows battling<br />
across a pitch of sky. Your news &mdash;<br />
flew from mouth to ear by wire and wave,<br />
it sets like bark around memories.<br />
<i>Why do you break us?</i> creak the buds<br />
to the wind; <i>why do you rip us?</i><br />
bluster the clouds. Around the twigs<br />
claws dig in, beaks bicker, wings flap.</p>
