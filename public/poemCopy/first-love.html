<p>You're drowning me: water<br />
blisters over the river's dirt bed &mdash; <br />
a bore-wall of branches, snakes, garbage<br />
dumped in the forgotten course. This flood<br />
of you pistons me through storm drains.</p>

<p><i>'Change must come'</i>, grumbles<br />
the corpse of a dog flushed <br />
from its grave of dust and tyres. </p>

<p>Now the surge sings, percussion streams<br />
harmonised with outlet gargles. Nerves <br />
get pinched, pressed in my skin &mdash; the hands<br />
of a giant who luges alongside me, holding me<br />
safe in his great grasp; he pushes my form<br />
through sewers, curving me into the sea.</p>

<p>You scare me; cleanse my veins<br />
in chemicals and drown my lungs.<br />
<i>'Breed'</i>, squirm the maggots in dogmeat &mdash;<br />
<i>'Breed like the gods have smashed<br />
the skins of the world!'</i></p>
