	<p>You're drowning me: water<br />
	blisters over the river's dirt bed &ndash; <br />
	a bore-wall of branches, snakes, garbage<br />
	dumped in the forgotten course. This flood<br />
	of you pistons me through storm drains.</p>

	<p><i>'Change must come'</i>, grumbles<br />
	the corpse of a dog flushed <br />
	from its grave of dust and tyres. </p>

	<p>Now the surge sings, percussion streams<br />
	harmonised with outlet gargles. Nerves <br />
	get pinched, pressed in my skin &ndash; the hands<br />
	of a giant who luges alongside me, holding me<br />
	safe in his great grasp; he pushes my form<br />
	through sewers, curving me into the sea.</p>

	<p>You scare me; cleanse my veins<br />
	in chemicals and drown my lungs.<br />
	<i>'Breed'</i>, squirm the maggots in dogmeat &ndash;<br />
	<i>'Breed like the gods have smashed<br />
	the skins of the world!'</i></p>
