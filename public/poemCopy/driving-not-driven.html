<p>Did I notice the signs? Perhaps<br />
it was the tone to your parked purr,<br />
or the way your seat cuddled into me <br />
as I pulled the belt to a hug<br />
across my full-inflated chest.</p>

<p>At every junction you chuckled,<br />
the choke from your old dirge gone.<br />
Each time my hand reached down<br />
to re-gear our touch lingered, warm.</p>

<p>No, I caught no sign of our truce:<br />
the metal fretworks decking the street<br />
stole my eyes from your dash. Today<br />
we fought killers beyond the wind shield,<br />
partners in our driving crimes.</p>
