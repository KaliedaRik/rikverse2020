	<p>Did I notice the signs? Perhaps<br />
	it was the tone to your parked purr,<br />
	or the way your seat cuddled into me <br />
	as I pulled the belt to a hug<br />
	across my full-inflated chest.</p>

	<p>At every junction you chuckled,<br />
	the choke from your old dirge gone.<br />
	Each time my hand reached down<br />
	to re-gear our touch lingered, warm.</p>

	<p>No, I caught no sign of our truce:<br />
	the metal fretworks decking the street<br />
	stole my eyes from your dash. Today<br />
	we fought killers beyond the wind shield,<br />
	partners in our driving crimes.</p>
