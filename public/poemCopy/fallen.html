<div aria-label="Poem body">
	<p>Here lies a church: its bricks, dis-mortared,<br />
	lump across the wild-grass park. A cross<br />
	topples into hawthorn thickets. Weathered graves<br />
	erupt crazed from once secret gardens.<br />
	One wall still stands, a messenger-board for old loves,<br />
	trite advice; affiliations.</p>

	<p>Here stands the mould of a boy, whose fingers drip<br />
	from small hands hugging a candle snuffed in the rain.<br />
	Cotton has been hung across the loins; a tide of soot<br />
	twines over the hair. The eyes have bleached; hoar-frosts<br />
	weave across the face. The feet are marked by passing dogs,<br />
	as is the pedestal, crusted in bottles and butts.</p>

	<p>Cold clouds shade the walls of the place where once I played.<br />
	Iron gates are rusted shut: gravel paths have grassed over<br />
	and thistles taint the playing greens. There are no rules<br />
	to keep now; no signposts; no borders. Just crumbling statues<br />
	to remember the past and the bricks of a universe<br />
	that fell long ago.</p>
