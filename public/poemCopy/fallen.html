<p>Here lies a church: its bricks, dis-mortared,<br />
lump across the wild-grass park. A cross<br />
topples into hawthorn thickets. Weathered graves<br />
erupt crazed from once secret gardens.<br />
One wall still stands, a messenger-board for old loves,<br />
trite advice; affiliations.</p>

<p>Here stands the mould of a boy, whose fingers drip<br />
from small hands hugging a candle snuffed in the rain.<br />
Cotton has been hung across the loins; a tide of soot<br />
twines over the hair. The eyes have bleached; hoar-frosts<br />
weave across the face. The feet are marked by passing dogs,<br />
as is the pedestal, crusted in bottles and butts.</p>

<p>Cold clouds shade the walls of the place where once I played.<br />
Iron gates are rusted shut: gravel paths have grassed over<br />
and thistles taint the playing greens. There are no rules<br />
to keep now; no signposts; no borders. Just crumbling statues<br />
to remember the past and the bricks of a universe<br />
that fell long ago.</p>
