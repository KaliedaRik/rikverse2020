<div aria-label="Poem body">
	<p>Sharp: a glance of you, bones <br />
	in skin, crooked smile and a promise <br />
	of lust and cool, bitter ale to wash <br />
	old food from my abscess tooth.</p>

	<p>Tart: a smart of lemon rubbed <br />
	with care across the stitch <br />
	of wounds our words embroider <br />
	into our hot, flush cheeks.</p>

	<p>Sweet: an ease in the throat, <br />
	a smile caught in sweat and snore <br />
	and windows open to welcome <br />
	a chill of November rain.</p>

	<p>Cold: a pulse of news to tousle <br />
	guts in macrame knots; peas <br />
	on the plate forked in patterns, <br />
	their mints a mystery, untongued.</p>

	<p>Salt: a cure for this rash <br />
	of scabbed recollections, <br />
	to refocus our life like eyes <br />
	on new kittens, fresh claws</p>

	<p>to make sharp our tart love: let us take <br />
	this sweet, cold strawberry heart <br />
	and add it to our pottage and sip <br />
	from the ladle together, again.</p>
