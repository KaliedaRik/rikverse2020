<p>My friends ask me: how much does that special smile<br />
of yours cost? I'll warn you now it's pricey:</p>

<p>not a trinket stacked on shelves in gift shops<br />
trading junk. You cannot wipe my palms</p>

<p>with coins and watch it swipe its muscley tricks<br />
across my face, nor will enticements bag you</p>

<p>that act &ndash; for a drink I'll swap a grin, and for food<br />
I'll pack a leer into our dialogue. But</p>

<p>my smile, my honest sweat-on-face with blushing grace<br />
stretch of lips and crowfeet tracks towards my ears,</p>

<p>deserves a deal only you can strike, my love, when<br />
you look at me with lids half-drawn across your eyes.</p>
