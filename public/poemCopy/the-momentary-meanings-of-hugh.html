	<p>He knows the mirror lies.</p>

	<p>It lied when he was six,<br />
	refused to catch the ghosts</p>

	<p>who whispered at his ear<br />
	within its dull blue frame.</p>

	<p>It lied when he was ten,<br />
	aching long whiles to draw</p>

	<p>the bruises on his face<br />
	he'd earned in playground brawls.</p>

	<p class="strophe-indented-with-italics">Wrap it. Bag it. Box it?<br />
	Move it. Shift it out and gone!</p>

	<p>It lied last night. It placed<br />
	the tears across her cheek</p>

	<p>when there were none. Her smile<br />
	did not translate. He knows</p>

	<p>this mirror lies: it shows<br />
	a stranger's life at him;</p>

	<p>it curses him, this plane<br />
	of gilt and long regard.</p>

	<p class="strophe-indented-with-italics">Smash it ...? No. Ten<br />
	thousand lies still lie!</p>

	<p>He knows the mirror must lie.</p>
