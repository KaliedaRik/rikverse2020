	<p>I smile to the video in the shop window.<br />
	Someone smiles at me from the stage of the TV.<br />
	When I wave, I wave back.</p>

	<p>I walk from work, along Victoria Street<br />
	to Parliament Square. Cameras<br />
	line the iron gates: I do not smile.<br />
	This is not my stage.<br />
	In the shadows of towers a polite man<br />
	talks to electronics. When he smiles,<br />
	I see headlined guile. The face is sincere:<br />
	the eyes laugh.</p>

	<p>Above, talking wires whisper<br />
	farewell to pre-neon light.<br />
	A great bell stirs in its analogue tower:<br />
	shivers a boom through cables and space &ndash;<br />
	I smile to a man behind a camera,<br />
	step away from his frame,<br />
	become free.</p>
