<p>I smile to the video in the shop window.<br />
Someone smiles at me from the stage of the TV.<br />
When I wave, I wave back.</p>

<p>I walk from work, along Victoria Street<br />
to Parliament Square. Cameras<br />
line the iron gates: I do not smile.<br />
This is not my stage.<br />
In the shadows of towers a polite man<br />
talks to electronics. When he smiles,<br />
I see headlined guile. The face is sincere:<br />
the eyes laugh.</p>

<p>Above, talking wires whisper<br />
farewell to pre-neon light.<br />
A great bell stirs in its analogue tower:<br />
shivers a boom through cables and space &mdash;<br />
I smile to a man behind a camera,<br />
step away from his frame,<br />
become free.</p>
