<p>I've been lost in memories so long,<br />
sieving ashes for clinkers.</p>

<p>I wake sick for a dead place, its echo<br />
an ember, brittle yet sharp.</p>

<p>I slept, watched membrances hatch<br />
&ndash; plasmas too chill for the touch</p>

<p>and yet I tried to hold each one close<br />
for they were me, once,</p>

<p>before I shattered myself for the gift<br />
of cock love &ndash; oh, I have sinned</p>

<p>and still I sin as I yawn and shake the dead<br />
me from my flesh and turn</p>

<p>and lag you tight in my limbs, my lover,<br />
for I must burn!</p>
