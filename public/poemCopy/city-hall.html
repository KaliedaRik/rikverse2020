<p>A welcome now for London's fair unlauded Mayor<br />
and his new house that slumps its arcs by Tower Bridge:<br />
this tit beside the Thames, its windows strung in scales<br />
of tinted glass upon the structured spiral stage;<br />
this glint of governance so kindly offered us<br />
by Foster's Follies, landmarks offered at a price;<br />
this grand metallic bollock landscaped in a truss<br />
of path and park environmental in its grace.</p>

<p>No ravens fly across the Thames to guard its flank<br />
and old Magog still grins his spell in London's heart.<br />
From power plants flows art, and cash breeds gilts in banks<br />
and I still walk, my step unchanged by this new start:<br />
an office grown to service London &ndash; hamstrung serf.<br />
A beacon of our city shackled at its birth.</p>
