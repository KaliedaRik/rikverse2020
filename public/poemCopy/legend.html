<p>He says: <i>I was not the first superhero<br />
to stride lightquick from mountain to town:<br />
sit close, seeker, and let us share words<br />
worthy of curses and judgements.</i></p>

<p>Gossip has drawn me to his artless nest<br />
of chromed rusts set deep in this cleft<br />
between skyscraped walls. Bee swarms<br />
tress from his scalp - a strength of sorts.</p>

<p><i>You should strangle angels with gifts,</i><br />
he tells me. <i>What mother would deny<br />
her own son the solace of wine, or beer?<br />
I never sought power; yet I am here.</i></p>

<p>Some call him Riddler; others whisper<br />
of slaughters and bloodlusts. I have a gun<br />
by my heart, its womb taut with bullets;<br />
brass cases line the jaw of his ass.</p>

<p><i>That one you seek &ndash; he is lost and found<br />
and lost again. Angels raped his mother,<br />
you know? He read his eulogies, screamed<br />
blood from his eyes. I was a judge, once,</i></p>

<p><i>and rendered temples to their foundations;<br />
you do not want to help that man. Salvation<br />
is a fool's gamble, a fixed deal. I tell you now:<br />
night will shatter when he sets down his verdict.</i></p>
