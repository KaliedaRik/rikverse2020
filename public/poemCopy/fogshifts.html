<div aria-label="Poem body">
	<p>Remember the day<br />
	I lost you in mist?<br />
	We chuckled like gutters.</p>

	<p>The bust camera<br />
	lost you in mist. I<br />
	still have the print.</p>

	<p>The mountain wreathed<br />
	you in mist. I lost<br />
	the path to the plain.</p>

	<p>We gathered for him<br />
	in mist. I lost you<br />
	to salted memories.</p>

	<p>I have no cure for<br />
	mist. I lost you in<br />
	searches for others</p>

	<p>Remember our flesh?<br />
	I lost you in mist<br />
	but never in touch.</p>
