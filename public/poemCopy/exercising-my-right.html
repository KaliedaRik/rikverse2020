<p>I voted for sausage, once, at a winter<br />
barbecue, but the drumsticks won and I<br />
went hungry. Again. <i>"Why do you insist</i></p>

<p><i>on being different?"</i> Who knows? I don't<br />
plan it. But whenever the chance comes<br />
for me to raise a hand, a finger, a pencil<br />
somehow I put the big cross right where</p>

<p>the treasure ain't buried. Like that bloke<br />
who surveyed Tenerife for an airport, put<br />
his X in the north to show the only spot<br />
on the island fatal to planes and then died<br />
before he could tell others. Boom, they went,<br />
those sturdy tin birds and there we had it:<br />
the best part of a thousand body bags<br />
over the years. So call me Cassandra</p>

<p>and see if I care &ndash; I'll always vote for facts,<br />
not faces or charm, because I can see<br />
the fat chancers at forty paces and I can tell<br />
the Edens they sell are as honest and useful<br />
as a sack of Canarian fog and even though</p>

<p>I know my side will lose still I will vote, not<br />
only because of the millions who fought<br />
for the right to top their kings as they saw fit<br />
but also in the hope that one happy day<br />
I'll eat barbecued sausage in the snow.</p>
