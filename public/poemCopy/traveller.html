	<h3>London, England </h3>

	<p>To remove the shirt as Man examines,<br />
	to unlace the boots, unclasp the belt,<br />
	is a task my head would run from.<br />
	But my need holds me in this room, assists<br />
	my hands unbutton my jeans, expose my feet<br />
	when the socks slip off. Man watches:<br />
	assesses from the door. No words are spoken.<br />
	No explanations. I know why I came.</p>

	<p>Even my need dampens as I stand centred<br />
	on rough carpet, hands ahead of a cottoned crotch.<br />
	I am looked in the eye. Slowly, thumbs are raised<br />
	and that last item drawn down, falling, until<br />
	I step away.</p>

	<p class='strophe-indented-with-italics'><i>Naked natives are rare on these streets.<br />
	Dalston moves to its own dim pulse,<br />
	masked by the moans of stop-start cars<br />
	daisy-chaining their journeys past rain topped gutters<br />
	gargling to my dreams, as I tight-walk kerbs.</i></p>

	<p>Man moves, reaches to me: takes wrists, hoods eyes<br />
	in a velvet bag. Fabric irritates a cheek.<br />
	I am led elsewhere, prod across wood,<br />
	tripped on steps. My toes count paces from habit.</p>

	<h3>Es Canar, Ibiza </h3>

	<p>This space is sharper, the air knobbling my skin.<br />
	On a cool silk of ceramic I am showered,<br />
	dried with aged wool. Powdered.<br />
	Then sat on plastic cold to my back.<br />
	Shackled and left.</p>

	<p class='strophe-indented-with-italics'><i>From the rosemary hill I can see the shore.<br />
	Sunheat is quelled by a breeze that flicks<br />
	watermounds from the depths into cliffs.<br />
	Resorts are gone from memory:<br />
	cicadas chisel new thoughts in my head.</i></p>

	<p class='strophe-indented-with-italics'><i>From the cliff top I watch a boat round the rocks.<br />
	Sailors prepare friends for their work below.</i></p>

	<p>Soft boot-falls alert me. The dressing dance starts.<br />
	A finger traces talc across the hair<br />
	of my thigh. Reaches down to massage the instep &ndash;<br />
	my response is admonished, bound tight in chill hoops.<br />
	Slowly, with textured suggestion, each acre of skin<br />
	is encased. Soon latex masters the curve of each leg,<br />
	tenses against the chest when I breathe.</p>

	<p>I blink when the hood is removed: watch the mask<br />
	approach. Swallow when a first strap tightens<br />
	across the crown of my head. Then a second.<br />
	Another snakes around the neck.</p>

	<p class='strophe-indented-with-italics'><i>I am the diver, ready to descend. I can see<br />
	Mediterranean waves waiting to swell across<br />
	the sweep of my suit, kneading<br />
	the waters within.</i></p>

	<p>Bound in shining black, I am shouldered to another place.<br />
	Back-lain, my calf is tied into a boot nailed to wood<br />
	tight so each vein-beat whips an ankle<br />
	angle trussed. The other foot follows.</p>

	<p>Man pulls pulleys. The plank is raised.<br />
	I swim in air.</p>

	<h3>Thessaloniki, Macedonia </h3>

	<p>The play starts. A camera whines.<br />
	Man considers each act before applying a pain.<br />
	Building patterns, pains paint across the swinging meat,<br />
	artistic swirls gloss the sweat bathed skin.<br />
	I cannot scream: a gag in the mouth presses the tongue,<br />
	but still howls heave down from the lungs to whisper<br />
	their way into the mask.</p>

	<p>Foot-strung, swing motions are built: testicle halters<br />
	controlling the pendulum's arc. Zips are un-toothed,<br />
	displaying choice zones for applications &ndash; clip props<br />
	and weights to tune the tension.</p>

	<p class='strophe-indented-with-italics'><i>The glitter of the sun touching on water burns my sight.<br />
	I have walked far through shaded streets leading to the promenade<br />
	where I sit: watching dross ebb across the bay.<br />
	From here I can see the white tower squat on the waterfront.<br />
	Greenery shawls each side of that hunchback of masonry<br />
	buckled from too much history.</i></p>

	<p class='strophe-indented-with-italics'><i>Aching, I rise: sun-dodge along the pattern paved decks<br />
	towards Salonika's pride</i></p>

	<p>Swing becomes top: I spin. Cramp grabs at my thigh,<br />
	tears blasphemies from a pinioned tongue.<br />
	The ache-rhythms increase their tempo,<br />
	merging and parting until they swarm<br />
	from crotch to navel to nipple to neck.</p>

	<p class='strophe-indented-with-italics'><i>In the tower, the sun is barred. From the ground door,<br />
	I circle my way through historic displays: old tombs<br />
	dug from the earth, their paintings protected<br />
	from damp airs. Up I climb, ingesting the theories<br />
	of Alexander and his sire. Too soon I am near the top,<br />
	dizzied, wandering past ikons pasted to plasterboard.<br />
	Each hero touched in gold. Each devil<br />
	cast in blood.</i></p>

	<p class='strophe-indented-with-italics'><i>One catches my eye. He hangs reversed from a cross, legs tied<br />
	to the strut. His hair falls wild and his forehead glints.<br />
	I can feel his tortures, his broken legs. I can feel the ropes<br />
	that clasp his wrists. He hangs alone, sways from nails<br />
	in his feet and preaches his pain for the glory of God.<br />
	His name is beyond me, yet I ache for his love<br />
	and I suffer in brotherhood, take his pain<br />
	into my heat and careful &ndash; so gently &ndash;<br />
	I kiss his gold-leaf lips</i> </p>

	<p>and all motion stops.</p>

	<h3>Corralejo, Fuerteventura </h3>

	<p class='strophe-indented-with-italics'><i>When the cloud base lifts from the land,<br />
	desolations surround me. Across the track<br />
	cold magmas heap in defiant stances, clinkers<br />
	making walls and turrets: outbursts of an old anger.</i></p>

	<p class='strophe-indented-with-italics'><i>There is no sound but a faint hiss of waves<br />
	breaking across the tumbled shore, stashing its cache<br />
	of white sand-grits wherever the rocks fault; slowly combing<br />
	the cauterised wounds under a sun-seeker's smooth bed.</i></p>

	<p>Skin lightens as implements detach. What was sharp<br />
	now glows. Heat travels within to touch each organ:<br />
	a scan of pleasure drawn deep in the pit.</p>

	<p>Between the legs a coldness arrives. Lubricant leaks<br />
	through the tight gate.</p>

	<p class='strophe-indented-with-italics'><i>I close my eyes: still the blacks and reds of this alien place<br />
	fill my head; frozen threats waiting to crush skulls.<br />
	Eyes open, I see the Atlantic sky as blue as varicose veins.<br />
	Weeds squat in cracks, leafless stems shake in the heat.</i></p>

	<p>Body-quakes break when Man touches the hole.<br />
	Muscles resist: a pressure builds.</p>

	<p class='strophe-indented-with-italics'><i>I tire of the track and branch away,<br />
	pitching across furrowed stone towards<br />
	stark cones grown from a dead vent.</i></p>

	<p>Arse kisses rapture. Licks and engulfs.</p>

	<p class='strophe-indented-with-italics'><i>The island shivers: rocks crack.<br />
	Clutching my stomach,<br />
	I scream.</i></p>

	<h3>Dalston, London </h3>

	<p>We rest chest to chest, our arms tousled across our forms.<br />
	In the corner a video recounts recent pleasures.<br />
	Smiling, we fondle with lips, enjoying the tastes<br />
	of exhaustion.</p>

	<p>Outside, evening clouds turn bitter, blanketing skies<br />
	with brutal storms. In the house a fire burns,<br />
	warming waters to churn past each room: radiators<br />
	whine their rusting complaints.</p>

	<p>Before the video finishes, I fall asleep on his shoulder.<br />
	There are no dreams.</p>
