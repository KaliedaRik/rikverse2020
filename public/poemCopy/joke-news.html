<p class='strophe-indented-with-italics'>"Did you read the news?<br />
If they bid for it<br />
the stadium goes here!"</p>

<p>We look around us, laugh.<br />
Beneath the Eastway's Aegyptian spans<br />
two stranded carpet sellers, smokes<br />
to mouths, their knock-down woven scrolls<br />
leaned along a length of white van.</p>

<p class='strophe-indented-with-italics'>"Why would the world<br />
want to come to Hackney &ndash;<br />
we're shut already!"</p>

<p>The dog track's gone, the Sunday market<br />
with it, its grits no more a base<br />
for rings of stalls and shouts<br />
and lines of dresses, shirts and jeans &ndash;<br />
designer labels sewn in for extra.<br />
No kids pile through the crowds<br />
to crash the trestles, knock change<br />
from pockets, hands, quick to grab<br />
the blag, play tag to caravans parked<br />
beyond the gates. Burgers in buns dressed<br />
in greased onions, watered ketchup &ndash;<br />
the salmonella gamble &ndash; all cleansed away.</p>

<p class='strophe-indented-with-italics'><i>"It won't happen,"</i> I say.<br />
<i>"It's no place for tourists<br />
or even normal people."</i></p>

<p>We walk on home. A litterbin melts<br />
as it burns &ndash; a belching flame<br />
for Hackney's nascent pride.</p>
