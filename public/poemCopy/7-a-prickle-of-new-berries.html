<p>A prickle of new berries where once<br />
petals whorled. The tree has greeened<br />
and grown; beauty is for the young.</p>

<p>My first tree was a fluff of emerald paint<br />
atop a buff stump. Now all I see are spaces.<br />
A good twig can apply a fine line.</p>

<p>Twenty one years: still our love ripens.</p>
