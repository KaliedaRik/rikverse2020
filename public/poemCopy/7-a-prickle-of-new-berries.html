<div aria-label="Poem body">
	<p>A prickle of new berries where once<br />
	petals whorled. The tree has greeened<br />
	and grown; beauty is for the young.</p>

	<p>My first tree was a fluff of emerald paint<br />
	atop a buff stump. Now all I see are spaces.<br />
	A good twig can apply a fine line.</p>

	<p>Twenty one years: still our love ripens.</p>
