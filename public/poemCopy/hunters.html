<div aria-label="Poem body">
	<p>From the desert brush a dappled cat <br />
	sleeks in through an open window, <br />
	noses the furniture: sits, <br />
	regards me with eyes of jasper. <br />
	Offering a back-hand for perusal, <br />
	it is accepted, rasped for salt, <br />
	marked and ignored. We gaze at shadows </p>

	<p>thrown from the torchlights close in the night. <br />
	Forms beyond call unseen, mouths in hand-cups: <br />
	identify and greet, carouse and touch. <br />
	I dress in cotton, abandon the room <br />
	and walk sand paths, hunting flesh. </p>

	<p>Gridded within rows and columns <br />
	of paint peeled collonnades, <br />
	prey can be found. I watch<br />
	moon-moths cascade in pheromones <br />
	over pillars supporting the wheeling star-plate: <br />
	when desert winds gust, some fail in the dance <br />
	and pillow towards my temple trap. </p>

	<p>I chase, leaping to claw great ghosts from the air, <br />
	fisting at wings. Palming a fat, flying grub <br />
	into the stocks of a decayed history. <br />
	Claiming the prize I breed fire, <br />
	strip wings and unhinge legs, <br />
	skewer the body on a copper rod. <br />
	Singe. Heat. Eat.</p>
