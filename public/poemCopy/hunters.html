<p>From the desert brush a dappled cat <br />
sleeks in through an open window, <br />
noses the furniture: sits, <br />
regards me with eyes of jasper. <br />
Offering a back-hand for perusal, <br />
it is accepted, rasped for salt, <br />
marked and ignored. We gaze at shadows </p>

<p>thrown from the torchlights close in the night. <br />
Forms beyond call unseen, mouths in hand-cups: <br />
identify and greet, carouse and touch. <br />
I dress in cotton, abandon the room <br />
and walk sand paths, hunting flesh. </p>

<p>Gridded within rows and columns <br />
of paint peeled collonnades, <br />
prey can be found. I watch<br />
moon-moths cascade in pheromones <br />
over pillars supporting the wheeling star-plate: <br />
when desert winds gust, some fail in the dance <br />
and pillow towards my temple trap. </p>

<p>I chase, leaping to claw great ghosts from the air, <br />
fisting at wings. Palming a fat, flying grub <br />
into the stocks of a decayed history. <br />
Claiming the prize I breed fire, <br />
strip wings and unhinge legs, <br />
skewer the body on a copper rod. <br />
Singe. Heat. Eat.</p>
