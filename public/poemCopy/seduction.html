<p>Can you hear the dogs?<br />
Each unleashed howl<br />
a cry to the storms<br />
seeded in spin?<br />
My love, slake this fear<br />
that will not sleep.</p>

<p class='strophe-indented'>Let's sleep<br />
with dogs,<br />
no fear<br />
of howls<br />
to spin<br />
our storms.</p>

<p>It takes an anvil to shape the storm,<br />
levering the puffy clouds of sleep<br />
and hoisting them high to the voids, where spin<br />
can shape their wetness, ice them into dogs<br />
or toads, or castles, or gods who howl<br />
cascades of coruscations &ndash; such fear!</p>

<p>Why do we fear<br />
the clout of our storms?<br />
I can show you how<br />
to devour change, rout sleep<br />
as we snout like dogs<br />
gouged by the pain of the spin.</p>

<p class='strophe-indented'>I spin<br />
in fear<br />
of dogs<br />
that storm<br />
my sleep:<br />
I howl!</p>

<p>Now we have thrust our howls<br />
through the sweat of pain and spin<br />
we can relax in each other, let sleep<br />
blunt the edge of our fears:<br />
we are the storms;<br />
we are, my love, the dogs.</p>

<p class='strophe-indented'>Dogs howl;<br />
storms spin:<br />
fear sleeps.</p>
