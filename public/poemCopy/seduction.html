	<p>Can you hear the dogs?<br />
	Each unleashed howl<br />
	a challenge to storms<br />
	chiselled from spin?<br />
	We must confront this fear<br />
	that will not sleep.</p>

	<p class='strophe-indented'>Let's sleep<br />
	among dogs,<br />
	no fear<br />
	of howls<br />
	to spin<br />
	our storms.</p>

	<p>It takes a focus to shape the storm,<br />
	to lever puffed clouds of unclaimed sleep<br />
	and hoist them high to the void, where spin<br />
	can shape their waters, ice them into dogs<br />
	or toads, or castles, or gods who howl<br />
	cascades of coruscations &ndash; such fear!</p>

	<p>We must gather our fear,<br />
	hold hard, tight to our storms.<br />
	We must wrap tight in our howl<br />
	and devour change, rout sleep<br />
	as we lick and snout like dogs<br />
	gorged on the pain of the spin.</p>

	<p class='strophe-indented'>I spin<br />
	in fear<br />
	of dogs<br />
	that storm<br />
	my sleep:<br />
	I howl!</p>

	<p>And done, our throat-strangled howl<br />
	thrust beyond our sweat, our taut spin.<br />
	Now we relax to the other, ease sleep<br />
	across our shaken limbs, our fears:<br />
	sated, tamed. We are become storms;<br />
	we are become, my sweet danger, dogs.</p>

	<p class='strophe-indented'>Dogs howl;<br />
	storms spin:<br />
	fear sleeps.</p>
