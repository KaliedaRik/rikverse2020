<p>I chose to dine at A's establishment:<br />
a restaurant well marked for style, panache<br />
and quality, a place for nourishment<br />
of soul and sense &mdash; at least they kept the trash</p>

<p>at bay when one's inclined to eat good food &mdash;<br />
or so I was informed. I ordered boar<br />
and settled back to contemplate the crude<br />
parade of riff-raff shambling past the door.</p>

<p>"My deeply felt apologies," a voice<br />
beside my elbow murmured. Looking down<br />
I saw the chiselled bones of service hoist<br />
into my view. "Why so?" I asked, a frown</p>

<p>across my brow. "We've had to bar the boar,"<br />
the waiter cringed: "It charged around the place<br />
creating havoc, carnage! Such a chore<br />
to clear the mess &mdash; we turfed it out, disgraced!"</p>

<p>Nonplussed, I checked the menu once again.<br />
"What else is there to eat?" The old man smiled,<br />
his lips a gruel of soup. "The chicken, plain,<br />
is rather good &mdash; a filling dish, par-boiled."</p>

<p>"But rather boring, I'd have thought?" He shook<br />
his head and said: "You do not understand, young sir,<br />
but plain is best &mdash; no sauce to hide the look,<br />
no herb or spice disguising taste! The bird</p>

<p>served bland delights the plate. Just try a breast<br />
or two." I was intrigued, I have to say:<br />
"You use no salt? No stuffing? Just undressed?"<br />
"Oh yes!" he said. "It is the only way</p>

<p>to exercise the muse! We don't allow<br />
ingredients to spoil the meal, the chefs<br />
must work in peace and comfort &mdash; once the row<br />
of discontent is banished, gone, they're left</p>

<p>with harmony in which to hone their skills<br />
and arts! A space where they can learn to shape<br />
their honest, soul-full heart-wrought chicken meals<br />
to feed our guests: a dish you can't escape!"</p>
