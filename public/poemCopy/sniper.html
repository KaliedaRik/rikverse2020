<p>Focus just here &ndash; I'll frame you in the street.<br />
A question: did you choose to wear that dress,<br />
that cardigan this morning? Or was its leaf<br />
knit pattern just there, slung across a chair<br />
as you hurried past, an afterthought plucked<br />
and strung around your shoulders? And your shoes &ndash;<br />
they look un-scuffed, the polish hints through dust.<br />
Your basket kept its shape as you fell, culled.</p>

<p>A camera stops. From a shop a hen waves<br />
her wattle into the air, steps from the door,<br />
clucks once, then pecks. A man runs to the corpse,<br />
his angle feet kicking some apples away &ndash;<br />
apples bought by his wife a minute before<br />
spilt from her wicker basket, witnessed by all.</p>
