<p>We find her hidden from invaders beyond a tight arched alley,<br />
beneath a bridge bricked between tenements. School kid shouts<br />
echo across the cobbled piazza whose puddles complete a mirror.</p>

as a Doge slumped in his woodworm throne. "We can have cake,"<br />
you hint, "and prosecco. Happy birthday, my dirty old queer!"</p>
