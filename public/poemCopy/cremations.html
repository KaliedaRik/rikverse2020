<p>The sun has swilled caskets of Spanish wine<br />
and reeled from its path &ndash; falling too far north.<br />
This summer bleaches me.<br />
The heat has stripped me naked and now<br />
I am laid out on a bed in a windowless room,<br />
burning, sweat dribbling past chest pubes<br />
to puddle my navel: I cannot sleep.</p>

<p>In my shorts I had walked from Leyton station<br />
past the Birbeck Arms on North Birbeck Road<br />
to the breath-stench tunnels of the Cathall Estate.<br />
In three weeks of heat the community lawns<br />
have painted their blades brown and followed the worms<br />
to deeper earths: feral rottweilers were tracking me,<br />
padding cautiously on my shadow,<br />
licking water from my blistered thighs.</p>

<p>Taking the oven-lift to an estate-tower roof,<br />
I found Leytonstone catholic graveyard<br />
laid out below: squared rows of granite crosses<br />
and marbled angels watching Birbeck fry.<br />
Two holes had been dug: black doors to heaven &ndash;<br />
no caskets filled them yet.<br />
The bereaved will wait until the bedding of the sun<br />
before laying to rest their memory-corpses:<br />
the departed reek less in the dusk.</p>
