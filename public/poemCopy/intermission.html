<p>I have a task half done. It stares<br />
at me from the incomplete list<br />
like a bellowed-at puppy, all eyes<br />
upturned. It dribbles intentions.</p>

<p>I am not alone. So many tasks<br />
to complete, say the Suited Mouths,<br />
but we can take them to completion<br />
with your belief, support (and cash).</p>

<p>I could hide, or muffle my ears<br />
with manifestos, or pimp my vote<br />
to the first brazen knocker on my door -<br />
but no: this is my puppy. The shiny</p>

<p>I see offered by the happy chatty <br />
heads shall not distract me, nor shall I<br />
let it pull the bile from my chest.<br />
I cuddle my task to my lap, feel it wag.</p>
