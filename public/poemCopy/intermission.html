<div aria-label="Poem body">
	<p>I have a task half done. It stares<br />
	at me from the incomplete list<br />
	like a bellowed-at puppy, all eyes<br />
	upturned. It dribbles intentions.</p>

	<p>I am not alone. So many tasks<br />
	to complete, say the Suited Mouths,<br />
	but we can take them to completion<br />
	with your belief, support (and cash).</p>

	<p>I could hide, or muffle my ears<br />
	with manifestos, or pimp my vote<br />
	to the first brazen knocker on my door -<br />
	but no: this is my puppy. The shiny</p>

	<p>I see offered by the happy chatty <br />
	heads shall not distract me, nor shall I<br />
	let it pull the bile from my chest.<br />
	I cuddle my task to my lap, feel it wag.</p>
