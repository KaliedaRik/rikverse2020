<p>Sprinting to work, late like the binmen, I spill<br />
crusts and rinds into a bucket on my doorstep.<br />
A fume of fungus spores lifts from the wastes<br />
and ribbons me &ndash; golden strands to stain my neck.</p>

<p>As I wait for a bus in Mare Street I spot<br />
a glass hearse hauled by plumed horses. Silver<br />
handles deck the white, bouquet-topped coffin<br />
stranded in the smog of rush-hour exhausts.</p>

<p>The bronze from my pocket will gift Hackney<br />
Town Hall some fresh adornments: we only have<br />
seven years to spruce our beloved corpse<br />
before the world arrives for the viewing.</p>
