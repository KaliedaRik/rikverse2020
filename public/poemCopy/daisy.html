<p>Where is Daisy's baby?<br />
Is it in the cardboard box?<br />
Perhaps it is wrapped in Daisy's coat?<br />
No. Here it is.<br />
It was sleeping in Daisy's plastic bag &ndash;<br />
The Sainsbury's one: they are big and strong.</p>

<p>Daisy takes baby out and cuddles it.<br />
Baby is cleaned and fed and burped<br />
and dressed up warm in Daisy's scarf,<br />
ready for the day.</p>

<p>Holding baby tight, Daisy wheels the trolley<br />
through Strutton Ground market to Victoria Street.<br />
Daisy talks to baby. Talks of tall buildings<br />
and cars; about buses and people, walking past.<br />
Baby listens, quiet, as a day watches Daisy go by.</p>

<p>When it rains, Daisy makes baby a place to sleep.<br />
Here is a cosy alcove &ndash; safe and dry.<br />
Daisy settles, places each bag<br />
all in their proper spots, close to hand.<br />
Then Daisy un-scarfs baby, washes its face,<br />
its button nose,</p>

<p>before tucking it up neatly in a new Tesco bag,<br />
with its fluffy ear and pretty orange eye<br />
poking through the handle. Sleepy and warm.<br />
Now Daisy says her goodnight prayer:<br />
God bless Jesus. God bless Mary.<br />
God bless baby, and Daisy too.</p>

<p>And baby sleeps.</p>
