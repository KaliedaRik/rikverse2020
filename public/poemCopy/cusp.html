<p>On the last morning of Summer<br />
I walked, automatic, to Leyton station.<br />
Over the graveyard wall chestnuts rained,<br />
spiked balls smacking onto pavements<br />
rimed by an early, watery frost.<br />
Cleaved, the pods tantalised boys<br />
with glimpses of polished, wood-veined eggs.<br />
Magpie-uniformed, the boys claimed their prizes,<br />
leaving me to follow, kicking husks.</p>

<p>On the first morning of Autumn<br />
I diverted my course to tread the gravelled paths<br />
that meandered beyond St Patrick's church.<br />
Deep mists silenced Leyton's coughing growls,<br />
whitened my sight. Swaying from verge to verge<br />
I searched for a russet jewel of my own.<br />
As I passed, shadows grew branches &ndash;<br />
leaves hung drying in the painted air,<br />
browning, then bleaching as I passed on.</p>

<p>Silence was breached with creaks. The mists<br />
began to clot, stirred by an inquisitive breeze<br />
mazed by the trees. A pocket of sight caught me.<br />
Ahead, granite angels stepped from pedestals,<br />
gathered in henges by slab mausoleums.<br />
Weathered mouths whistled conversations, lichened hands<br />
picked moss from carved hair. One saw me: frowned.<br />
I froze as its hand chiselled to the ground, hurled<br />
a smooth grained sphere into the side of my head.</p>

<p>A darkness left. Splashes on my cheek roused me.<br />
I lay between Eileen Murphy and her sister Maude<br />
Both gathered with Jesus in ninteen fifty four.<br />
The mists were gone, flushed by the rain.<br />
I sat up, shaking my head, touching a bruise<br />
above my ear. A distant train rumbled into a tunnel.<br />
By my foot a small conker lay, glowing in the grass.<br />
I picked it up: rubbed its cool leather dry. Uncertain,<br />
I remembered work. Pocketing my prize,<br />
I slipped away.</p>
