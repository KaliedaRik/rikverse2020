	<p>For some you are pretty to look at; to others <br />
	a quirk of nature, a passage of time. <br />
	I know I am smaller than you, and you <br />
	are my teacher. </p>

	<p>From the moment the rip-tide tore <br />
	the waters from my cot and life's <br />
	breath stung my lungs, you have <br />
	taught me. </p>

	<p>Through your filter I have touched <br />
	the world, seen through its shadows, <br />
	its secrets. Your revolution fixed my path, <br />
	set my actions before me. </p>

	<p>You sicken me. I dodged your shadow <br />
	as it judged the land, watched it fall <br />
	a hundred miles south (though at the last <br />
	my shadow deserted me). </p>

	<p>And I felt the breath of your lesson <br />
	rush a curving swathe across the sea, <br />
	the land, past Paris and Turkey to the oceans <br />
	beyond India. </p>

	<p>Murderous bitch! Kings should have died, <br />
	not the streets of shoddy Golcuk. Money loving mizers <br />
	should have knelt helpless before you, not <br />
	the towers of Istambul. </p>

	<p>Once more to me you teach an end. <br />
	I cling to the frame of the door you rip <br />
	from my grasp, deny my eyes the sight <br />
	of mortality, </p>

	<p>relieved that my soil stays solid, that <br />
	Hackney stands still, and I in it,  <br />
	and in a week your face will shine full. <br />
	And I will adore you again.</p>
