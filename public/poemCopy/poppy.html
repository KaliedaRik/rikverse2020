<p>They say: we must remember!<br />
And while I do understand<br />
<i>Dulce et decorum est pro<br />
patria mori</i> it's the rest<br />
of the lines that squeeze<br />
my eyes to pain. So then,<br />
should I wear you, little<br />
tatter of red card stuck<br />
on your bendy green stick<br />
for the next week or so?</p>

<p>Because you mean more than<br />
horror today, pretty flower.<br />
This button is a token.<br />
It says: I belong; I am<br />
proud of my patria. It says:<br />
we are British, great among<br />
nations, better than lesser<br />
types &mdash; undefeated warriors<br />
stand tall and free; obey<br />
our leaders, who know best.</p>

<p>You say: to refuse my flag<br />
is to shit in the skulls<br />
of people who died to keep<br />
you safe &mdash; but those people<br />
bled from shrapnels, gases<br />
and fevers while generals<br />
shot pheasant. I say: no.<br />
This land is not that land;<br />
my will not yours to command:<br />
I mourn for England today.</p>
