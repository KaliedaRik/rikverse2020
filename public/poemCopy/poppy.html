	<p>They say: we must remember!<br />
	And while I do understand<br />
	<i>Dulce et decorum est pro<br />
	patria mori</i> it's the rest<br />
	of the lines that squeeze<br />
	my eyes to pain. So then,<br />
	should I wear you, little<br />
	tatter of red card stuck<br />
	on your bendy green stick<br />
	for the next week or so?</p>

	<p>Because you mean more than<br />
	horror today, pretty flower.<br />
	This button is a token.<br />
	It says: I belong; I am<br />
	proud of my patria. It says:<br />
	we are British, great among<br />
	nations, better than lesser<br />
	types &ndash; undefeated warriors<br />
	stand tall and free; obey<br />
	our leaders, who know best.</p>

	<p>You say: to refuse my flag<br />
	is to shit in the skulls<br />
	of people who died to keep<br />
	you safe &ndash; but those people<br />
	bled from shrapnels, gases<br />
	and fevers while generals<br />
	shot pheasant. I say: no.<br />
	This land is not that land;<br />
	my will not yours to command:<br />
	I mourn for England today.</p>
