<p><i aria-label="speaker: other">"There is a deep-sea Jesus who once hammered<br />
his hands into coral for the glory of God."</i></p>

<p>I nod at his words, wise to his tales.<br />
<i aria-label="speaker: narrator">"Does he eat rafts of sharks for breakfast?"</i></p>

<p>His smile is a tight line, un-arched,<br />
a clench of flesh in the egg of his head.</p>

<p><i aria-label="speaker: other">"He has wracks for his hair-locks &ndash; he would die<br />
for your sins!"</i> I kneel already: my elbows</p>

<p>denting his pastel thigh &ndash; so soft, this knit<br />
of oil-dark tufts that net my fingers.</p>

<p><i aria-label="speaker: narrator">"How do you know this,"</i> I ask his eyes,<br />
five fathoms above; watch as they close.</p>

<p>Like a spring tide his palms spread<br />
their warm weight over my scalp &ndash;</p>

<p>knead and sculpt, push deep my wrasse lips<br />
to consume the treasures that anchor our needs.</p>
