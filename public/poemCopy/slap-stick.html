<p>Imagine a copse of clown-trees,<br />
she says, with revolving bow ties<br />
for leaves and bright red nose buds.</p>

<p>Do the flowers squirt brass bees<br />
with nectar, I ask. Oh yes,<br />
she agrees: it is a necessary prank;</p>

<p>how else can the shoe seeds form?<br />
They dangle in long pairs from the boughs,<br />
you know, and drop with the first frost</p>

<p>to the hard ground, slapping down<br />
among puff balls and stinkhorns:<br />
who painted your face so sad?</p>
