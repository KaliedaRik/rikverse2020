<p><span aria-label="speaker: her">Imagine a copse of clown-trees,</span><br />
she says, <span aria-label="speaker: her">with revolving bow ties<br />
for leaves and bright red nose buds.</span></p>

<p><span aria-label="speaker: narrator">Do the flowers squirt brass bees<br />
with nectar</span>, I ask. <span aria-label="speaker: her">Oh yes,</span><br />
she agrees: <span aria-label="speaker: her">it is a necessary prank;</span></p>

<p><span aria-label="speaker: her">how else can the shoe seeds form?<br />
They dangle in long pairs from the boughs,<br />
you know, and drop with the first frost</span></p>

<p><span aria-label="speaker: her">to the hard ground, slapping down<br />
among puff balls and stinkhorns:<br />
who painted your face so sad?</span></p>
