<p>You bought the first calculator<br />
the village had seen. A brick<br />
of a machine with hard plastic<br />
buttons and American batteries.<br />
All the way from Texas. We<br />
took turns to test the new toy:<br />
magic arithmetic at the clack<br />
of a click.</p>

<p>The smallest telly money could buy<br />
was yours. Four inches of screen<br />
packed between radio and tape deck.<br />
We lined up to view the almost<br />
picture, guess at the grey-grain shapes<br />
flattering within.</p>

<p>Your eight track tape cassettes still saw<br />
good use, even after the fashion passed.<br />
You liked the music, the shape,<br />
the selection switch.</p>

<p>You left us too soon: <br />
computers are constructed<br />
with you in mind.</p>
