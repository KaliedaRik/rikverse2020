	<p>You bought the first calculator<br />
	the village had seen. A brick<br />
	of a machine with hard plastic<br />
	buttons and American batteries.<br />
	All the way from Texas. We<br />
	took turns to test the new toy:<br />
	magic arithmetic at the clack<br />
	of a click.</p>

	<p>The smallest telly money could buy<br />
	was yours. Four inches of screen<br />
	packed between radio and tape deck.<br />
	We lined up to view the almost<br />
	picture, guess at the grey-grain shapes<br />
	flattering within.</p>

	<p>Your eight track tape cassettes still saw<br />
	good use, even after the fashion passed.<br />
	You liked the music, the shape,<br />
	the selection switch.</p>

	<p>You left us too soon: <br />
	computers are constructed<br />
	with you in mind.</p>
