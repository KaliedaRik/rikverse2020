<p>They fish in silence &mdash; the man, <br />
the heron. When one casts its beak <br />
through the mirror course the other <br />
whip-ducks his fly. Slow the ripples <br />
travel, armadas cruising the canal; <br />
where the waves cross a stickleback <br />
giants and dwarfs, nest-weed in mouth.</p>
