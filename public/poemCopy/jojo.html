<p>When you glove my hand in yours I hold<br />
breath in my throat, count ruby stars<br />
as they drift within shuttered lids.</p>

<p>A pitch in my ear, a whine; carpet tufts trip<br />
at my toes; a huff of aged bacon; the sweat<br />
of your palms as you pull at my arm.</p>

<p>I spread fingers, take the mewling weight &ndash;<br />
soft and hot and bones in fur: so puny,<br />
this kitten, her claws clasped on my thumb.</p>

<p>Open our eyes: the birth of us is done.</p>
