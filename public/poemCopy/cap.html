		<p class="level-with-top">We first met when I threw the ornament<br />
		who wore you into the fish pond. Red</p>

		<p>you were then, a fighter's colour drawn<br />
		from chalked madder, your throne</p>

		<p>those angry barricades that drew blood<br />
		from the necks of kings. Common as muck,</p>

		<p>you, your felts supping the sweats of free men.<br />
		Do you miss the young god you once rode</p>

		<p>deep in his alcoved pits? Do you miss feasts?<br />
		I can hear you whispering secrets to gnomes.</p>
