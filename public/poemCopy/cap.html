<p aria-label="Epigraph" class="epigraph">(After a bust of the demi-god Attis)</p>

<p>We first met when I threw the ornament<br />
who wore you into the fish pond. Red</p>

<p>you were then, a fighter's colour drawn<br />
from chalked madder, your throne</p>

<p>those angry barricades that drew blood<br />
from the necks of kings. Common as muck,</p>

<p>you, your felts supping the sweats of free men.<br />
Do you miss the young god you once rode</p>

<p>deep in his alcoved pits? Do you miss feasts?<br />
I can hear you whispering secrets to gnomes.</p>
