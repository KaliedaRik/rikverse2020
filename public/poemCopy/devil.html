	<p>Wally's World is a wonder of the art,<br />
	its ingenuity held together with scaffold<br />
	and cable, pins and paint. We can erect this show<br />
	in fifteen minutes: home-crafted light-boxes,<br />
	second-hand strobes, the decks, the great front<br />
	board, with Wally's World written in red<br />
	across its length. And we are set.</p>

	<p>Afternoon or evening, birthday or wedding<br />
	we pack halls across East Kent with our rhythm,<br />
	entertaining spruced, scented hordes with disco<br />
	and soul, with Two-tone and Motown. You start<br />
	on the light and bitter, to oil your joints.<br />
	I start with a shandy and a shaking fit,<br />
	knowing the hall will watch me play, waiting<br />
	until the alcohol kicks in and the chat gears up.</p>

	<p>You work the front: kiss bride or birthday girl.<br />
	Assess your audience, drink, then dance. Snake<br />
	your neck chains across your chest. Whip<br />
	your hips tight in their jeans. Swing. Pick<br />
	the lady. Pounce. I play. Professional<br />
	in my intros, my dedications. Master<br />
	of the microphone. Devil of the decks.</p>
