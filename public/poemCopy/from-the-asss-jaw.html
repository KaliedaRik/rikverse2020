<p>He's old, this one, blind<br />
as he walks in the steps<br />
of a child. His breath<br />
smells sweet, brandy in flame; <br />
his lungs buzz. I shake my head &ndash;</p>

<p><i aria-label="speaker: narrator">"We are what we do, no more."</i></p>

<p>He laughs. <i aria-label="speaker: client">"A harsh judgement<br />
you place on my back; I have killed<br />
many men. A child of the sun<br />
can do no more than follow<br />
the knots embraided in his hair."</i></p>

<p><i aria-label="speaker: narrator">"I have no comb to change you!"</i></p>

<p>He knocks bills from the desk<br />
as he leans to my face: I see<br />
midnight enthroned in sockets.<br />
<i aria-label="speaker: client">"I chose to push the pillars,"</i><br />
he says, <i aria-label="speaker: client">"cascade that stony sky &ndash;</i></p>

<p><i aria-label="speaker: client">"I am a good judge. Are you?"</i></p>
