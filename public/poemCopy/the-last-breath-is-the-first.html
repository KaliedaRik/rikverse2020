<div aria-label="Poem body">
	<p>It's been a heavy year, my love,<br />
	like weights around a diver's chill waist<br />
	dragging our faces through brine</p>

	<p>and yet here we are, separated<br />
	as fireworks fizz and bust between us<br />
	your voice in my ear at midnight &ndash;</p>

	<p class="strophe-indented-with-italics">Happy New Year!<br />
	Happy! Happy!<br />
	Love You!</p>

	<p>&ndash; and then you're gone, dead line<br />
	as the frail patients on your night-watch list<br />
	seek comfort from deep memories</p>

	<p>and I on my knees at prayer<br />
	to a shattered night sky: give us strength<br />
	to draw joy from each other</p>

	<p>and calm when I hear your key unlock<br />
	our shared door as I wake and welcome you<br />
	like bubbles in dance under waves.</p>
