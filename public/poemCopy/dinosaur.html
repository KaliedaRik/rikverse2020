<div aria-label="Poem body">
	<p>I have a dinosaur perched in my palm.  <br />
	It should be free, but the arm <br />
	is bloodied. I look within the fixed eye <br />
	as I swab the parallel gouges <br />
	clean.</p>

	<p>Cat curses pounce across my back. <br />
	When I look back he ignores me, <br />
	disdain shivering the stout brush tail. <br />
	Ear flicks inform me I shall pay <br />
	for thieving his toy.</p>

	<p>The wound clots. Alien muscles slip <br />
	within the rainbow skin, restless. <br />
	As I un-cup my hands a sharp, ritual peck stabs <br />
	my thumb. It runs, forelimbs sprint-pumping <br />
	as it gaits away.</p>
