<p>There exists this old outfit called Google<br />
Whose procedures are doing my noodle!<br />
Every action I try<br />
They refuse and deny<br />
~~~ bugger it! Just bring me a Big Magnet, an axe and directions to their nearest data center &hellip;</p>

<p>The cloud is a wide and fluffy place<br />
full of data and space and all things nice.<br />
It takes you by charm<br />
and fucks you to harm<br />
~~~ I'm looking at you, Amazon Web Services - you're next for the Big Magnet treatment if you don't start playing nicely with me pretty damn quickly! You hearing me, huh? BIG Magnet!</p>
