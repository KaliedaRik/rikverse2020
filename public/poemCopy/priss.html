<p>A shadow has stalked from the room,  <br />
diminishing to the sway-flick outline <br />
of a tip-broken tail as the cat that owns it pads <br />
along a corridor newly sensed. Whiskers alert, <br />
her raucous calls still echo in my ears, <br />
her backskin sharpened claws sheathed, <br />
the damage done with an unplanned rent <br />
in the time-toughened fabric of my love. </p>

<p>I didn't plan to cry: the task of fixing <br />
the mischief made by my demanding, dependant, <br />
eating, crapping demon of purr and fur keeps catching <br />
on flashback memories &ndash; tripping over string-tied mice, <br />
cracked ping-pong balls rediscovered in the corners <br />
of rooms. I claim to have developed an allergy <br />
to her moulted hair. Dare others to look beyond <br />
the surface of my reddened, streaming eyes.</p>
