<div aria-label="Poem body">
	<p>Snow on the bough snuggles about<br />
	the form of a blackbird, her brown feathers<br />
	still, now, her hymn stolen by the gale<br />
	buffeting the twigs that built her cage.</p>

	<p>So cold, this weather. A chorus of beaks<br />
	unite, for a moment, to mark the end<br />
	of a heart-rent song sent to the heavens<br />
	too soon, too soon. A snowdrop blooms.</p>
