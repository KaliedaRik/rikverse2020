<p>There is no chill to the mists that lap<br />
between the bars of this cage. The man<br />
I seek sits on the gate's step, his neck<br />
chained in the bones and nails of thumbs<br />
and toes. His teeth are flint, his torso<br />
a marble of sweat and soot and vein.</p>

<p class="italic">"Are you here to beg, or fight? I see you can<br />
count to ten: an unholy edge in this game."</p>

<p>Beyond the steel arena litter pits flicker<br />
with new-sprouted flame; shadows<br />
of a crowd clot in huddles, their murmurs<br />
a purr of anticipations. A drum of moonshine<br />
fountains when a pick bites its purloined lid.<br />
I ask about heroes with holes in their hands.</p>

<p class="italic">"He brawls like a wildfire, that one. His haul<br />
of sliced trophies near matches my own."</p>

<p>The cage is small, six paces to a side<br />
and barely a hop to grasp the bars<br />
that span its roof. The floor is a mud<br />
of blood; I can read screams in the slide<br />
of foot-stamps. Hair mats the gate's hinges.<br />
An eye has spat its cataract onto the lock.</p>

<p class="italic">"The rabble here, they love his lethal dismay;<br />
I have his number, if you have the moves."</p>
