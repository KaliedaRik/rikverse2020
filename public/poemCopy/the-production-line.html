<p>Within the workshop:<br />
Spring springs novel strophes, pearls rhymes &ndash;<br />
Attention births a poem.</p>

<p>A poet reviews:<br />
The churned rush of seasons season and cut<br />
Iamb lines to offal.</p>

<p>On the garden bench<br />
A reader reads: precious as soft fall rain,<br />
The lips barely move.</p>
