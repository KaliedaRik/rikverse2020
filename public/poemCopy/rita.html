	<p>We gather like clotting scrapes, a clutter<br />
	of people drawn to her door. "It needs<br />
	to be managed; she has no one, no friends<br />
	to help her sort herself." I'm late<br />
	to the crowd, rogue starling, tumbling<br />
	after the flock. "She thought the world</p>

	<p>of him," my neighbour says. "Her world<br />
	was nailed to his; look at the clutter<br />
	in this garden!" Amid the tumbling<br />
	frames a crocus unfurls, the needs<br />
	of its cycle pushed by a threat of late<br />
	frost. Gust-whipped, it seeks friends</p>

	<p>... I suppose at a push you can call them friends:<br />
	early bees sipping through the world<br />
	one sugar pot at a time. "Her late<br />
	husband?" I ask. He nods, the clutter<br />
	of chatter now growing louder: who needs<br />
	to do what, and how, and when. Tumbling</p>

	<p>overhead is a skirl of clouds, tumbling<br />
	like lambs let loose in the field, friends<br />
	on the lam from the afternoon sun. "She needs<br />
	some spring smiles to thaw her world,"<br />
	he decides. Welters of lines clutter<br />
	his face. Glancing about, I can relate</p>

	<p>to his want &ndash; I know I saw her late<br />
	last year, a cambered matron tumbling<br />
	from the pavement's cracked kerb to clutter<br />
	up the road with her shopping. We were frail friends;<br />
	she refused my help, scared that the world<br />
	would scoff at her trivial widow's needs.</p>

	<p>"Don't fret for me. It's my son who needs<br />
	the help," she told me. "He's always late,<br />
	but it's not his fault, poor lad! The world<br />
	won't give him a breath or a break, tumbling<br />
	him between chaos and crisis &ndash; his friends<br />
	don't help; he can do without my clutter!"</p>

	<p>Our story is clutter, like hers; boxed needs<br />
	biding to be sorted by friends come too late:<br />
	you're tumbling too fast from my world.</p>
