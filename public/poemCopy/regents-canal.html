<p>Dogs walking their owners<br />
bow legs and bristles<br />
tattooed and snouted<br />
calf-exposed, sweat-nosed<br />
barking at mates<br />
by cell-phone.</p>

<p>Office work strewn over lawns<br />
barefoot meetings, diary<br />
confirmations applied<br />
like cream over strawberry<br />
burns &ndash; the first tan line<br />
of the season filed.</p>

<p>Inside the site-work cages<br />
move cranes &ndash; they spell runes<br />
across a hot blue sky;<br />
men in yellow hats clad<br />
skeleton structures<br />
in bricks and planks.</p>

<p>Midstream a swan ducks<br />
and scrapes bubbled fronds<br />
from the mud, green scraps<br />
staining orange keratin<br />
and I keep to my walk<br />
though toes bleed.</p>
