<p>Dogs exercise owners:<br />
twig legs trot muscled chests<br />
and neck tats, sweat shined,<br />
animated by snuffs and barks<br />
at mobile tethered mates.</p>

<p>Clerks strew over lawns:<br />
slow meetings, laptops agape.<br />
Bare feet in fresh grass blush<br />
like strawberries as disputes<br />
settle into chats, smiles.</p>

<p>High wire-knit fences corral<br />
great cranes: quick they erect<br />
new skylines &ndash; skeleton struts<br />
to frame an ache of blue sky<br />
and yellow hardhat acrobats.</p>

<p>Swift cyclists, slow joggers:<br />
for each I hop to the bank.<br />
Mid-canal, two ducks fight<br />
over green weeds. My heels ache<br />
from steps and soft blisters.</p>
