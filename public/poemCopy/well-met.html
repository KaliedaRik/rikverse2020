	<p>Four moons in the sky tonight: new waxed full<br />
	waned &ndash; what gift is this? I thought you trouble<br />
	when we met, big boots and attitude enough<br />
	to tip the world to bruises.</p>

	<p>This scratch etches across a serpent's head<br />
	inked through skin to the bone within. We lie<br />
	in a bed of hawthorns and nettles: you, me,<br />
	poisons, provocations.</p>

	<p>I like the way you flinch as I push a digit's tip<br />
	in traces over your blistered thigh. Your eyes<br />
	catch satellites in tear-pools; your fingers net<br />
	a skull as we mix lips.</p>

	<p>Who are you, bully machine? What brings you<br />
	here to me, to my pop-up nest of hurts<br />
	and hopes to let my limbs surround your flesh<br />
	with sweat and urgent heat?</p>

	<p>I strip dock sheets from their stalk, crush them<br />
	for juice and balm my wheals &ndash; my hedgerow<br />
	birthright gives me this know, even here<br />
	in your city of dreams.</p>

	<p><i>"What's your name, mate?"</i>&nbsp; My name is silence.<br />
	It takes a minute for me to dress and leave<br />
	our bower, step goat-sure through derelictions.<br />
	Clouds rile the heavens.</p>
