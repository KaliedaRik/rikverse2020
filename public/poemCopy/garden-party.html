<p>I spot a crease in the lap<br />
of your shirt, there by the hip;<br />
a moment's stroke teases<br />
the cloth flatter &ndash; did you notice<br />
me touch you? Hands at your neck:<br />
I watch as they weave a knot<br />
along the nylon luster<br />
that garottes your throat &ndash;</p>

<p>"You look good," I say, no lie<br />
in my words. "You'll out-queen<br />
the Queen herself!" Your shrug<br />
is a novel of nerves and conquests,<br />
your smile a story half-told &ndash;<br />
a legend tensed to break bud.</p>

<p>Some days the pride I feel<br />
for you stabs in my lungs<br />
so hard it slaughters words<br />
like caged piglets &ndash; do you notice<br />
my joy when we share space,<br />
you and me, the world beyond?<br />
I spot a crumb on your lip,<br />
thumb it away as you tell me<br />
your plot to rule this day.</p>
