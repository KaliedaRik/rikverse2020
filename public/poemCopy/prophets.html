<p>Her pivot is her globe.<br />
It sits between us, a gem<br />
of unbubbled glass swirled<br />
in transluscent reflections.</p>

<p>Her hoops are for show:<br />
I show her a palm, pin<br />
my eyes to her pulled lobe<br />
as she seeks secrets in lines.</p>

<p>My lode is her creased face &ndash;<br />
matching gulleys channel anger<br />
from the nip of her nose up;<br />
botox could veil her pain.</p>

<p>"I can see money," she says.<br />
I can see addictions etched<br />
in her jaundiced fingers<br />
as they stroke my wrist.</p>

<p>We thank each other, sip<br />
at thin china, guess weather.<br />
As I leave, I see patterns<br />
in clouds: ill omens in greys.</p>
