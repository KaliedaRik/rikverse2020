	<p>For solace, she turns to paper. <br />
	First, she inks the dog: <br />
	stylized eyes edged by tufted ears, <br />
	a tongue dripping past canine spikes. <br />
	Then from the tail a flower bursts: <br />
	two-stroke leaves bracketing petals, <br />
	pushing towards the edge of her realm. </p>

	<p>She continues. A tone develops. <br />
	Swapping pastels she hashes a roof <br />
	that builds &ndash; lintels down &ndash; to house, <br />
	then mansion, skirting its walls <br />
	ninety degrees to its highest points. <br />
	Detail is paid on the ivy <br />
	clambering to shutter <br />
	curtained windows. </p>

	<p>The pen stalls on the first bird. <br />
	Large, hook-billed, block-pooled eye <br />
	side on to gaze directly out. <br />
	An image to engage her, shiver her. <br />
	She stares above the page. Recollects. <br />
	Feathers are applied to the skull. </p>

	<p>A clock chimes: break a mood. Break away. </p>

	<p>Freed from control, the hand <br />
	buckles its muscles around the pen <br />
	and leaps upon the last open space, <br />
	populating skies above the dog <br />
	with bracket wings and circumflex stars. <br />
	Brick-windows smash and ivy blooms <br />
	and finally Jennifer <br />
	smiles.</p>
