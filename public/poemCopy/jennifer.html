<p>For solace, she turns to paper. <br />
First, she inks the dog: <br />
stylized eyes edged by tufted ears, <br />
a tongue dripping past canine spikes. <br />
Then from the tail a flower bursts: <br />
two-stroke leaves bracketing petals, <br />
pushing towards the edge of her realm. </p>

<p>She continues. A tone develops. <br />
Swapping pastels she hashes a roof <br />
that builds &mdash; lintels down &mdash; to house, <br />
then mansion, skirting its walls <br />
ninety degrees to its highest points. <br />
Detail is paid on the ivy <br />
clambering to shutter <br />
curtained windows. </p>

<p>The pen stalls on the first bird. <br />
Large, hook-billed, block-pooled eye <br />
side on to gaze directly out. <br />
An image to engage her, shiver her. <br />
She stares above the page. Recollects. <br />
Feathers are applied to the skull. </p>

<p>A clock chimes: break a mood. Break away. </p>

<p>Freed from control, the hand <br />
buckles its muscles around the pen <br />
and leaps upon the last open space, <br />
populating skies above the dog <br />
with bracket wings and circumflex stars. <br />
Brick-windows smash and ivy blooms <br />
and finally Jennifer <br />
smiles.</p>
