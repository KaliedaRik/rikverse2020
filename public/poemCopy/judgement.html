<p>This was not the way for a man to die,<br />
tied to your cot in a room away from sight,<br />
tubes trickling relief from pain into your veins,<br />
guiding your mind deeper into morphine dreams.<br />
I tried to listen to your wandering conversation,<br />
but all I could focus on was your tongue, bitten blue<br />
as you chewed your words, your fears, scabbing<br />
around your mouth, tipping truths and lies past <br />
yellowing teeth &mdash; a reptilian rogue in your head.</p>

<p>Six weeks it took, from father to corpse. <br />
Forty five days for that new life to spring <br />
from obscurity to attention, to feed on <br />
your blood, squeeze your bowels, stretch<br />
your stomach tight and round to flatten<br />
even your navel at the end.</p>

<p>That last night you regained your youth. Visioned<br />
the abattoir in which you once worked. You woke<br />
the ward with your terror: convinced the bed opposite<br />
was a bullock bought to the cull, and you to drag it<br />
shitting and baying to the stall to shatter its head. Its<br />
carcass to fall, hooves clattering the gutters <br />
and you left to shovel gore from the floor.</p>

<p>Doctors would not let me witness your final fight.<br />
Instead you were tied tight to your cot and wheeled<br />
to a solitary room, to let the morphine drip evenly<br />
into your arm, to let your scabfucked tongue slip still,<br />
to let nature take its paced time to ease you <br />
from life.</p>
