	<p>This was not the way for a man to die,<br />
	tied to your cot in a room away from sight,<br />
	tubes trickling relief from pain into your veins,<br />
	guiding your mind deeper into morphine dreams.<br />
	I tried to listen to your wandering conversation,<br />
	but all I could focus on was your tongue, bitten blue<br />
	as you chewed your words, your fears, scabbing<br />
	around your mouth, tipping truths and lies past <br />
	yellowing teeth &ndash; a reptilian rogue in your head.</p>

	<p>Six weeks it took, from father to corpse. <br />
	Forty five days for that new life to spring <br />
	from obscurity to attention, to feed on <br />
	your blood, squeeze your bowels, stretch<br />
	your stomach tight and round to flatten<br />
	even your navel at the end.</p>

	<p>That last night you regained your youth. Visioned<br />
	the abattoir in which you once worked. You woke<br />
	the ward with your terror: convinced the bed opposite<br />
	was a bullock bought to the cull, and you to drag it<br />
	shitting and baying to the stall to shatter its head. Its<br />
	carcass to fall, hooves clattering the gutters <br />
	and you left to shovel gore from the floor.</p>

	<p>Doctors would not let me witness your final fight.<br />
	Instead you were tied tight to your cot and wheeled<br />
	to a solitary room, to let the morphine drip evenly<br />
	into your arm, to let your scabfucked tongue slip still,<br />
	to let nature take its paced time to ease you <br />
	from life.</p>
