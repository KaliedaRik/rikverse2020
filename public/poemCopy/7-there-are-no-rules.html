<div aria-label="Poem body">
	<p>There are no rules for those who wait.<br />
	She swallows the starling whole:<br />
	as it beats, the heart grates her chest.</p>

	<p>Rules are made for breaking the hearts<br />
	of the little people. Watch the swallow:<br />
	a feathered boomerang curves across the sky.</p>

	<p>When the angels called, she was not at home.</p>
