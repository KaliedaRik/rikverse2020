<p>There are no rules for those who wait.<br />
She swallows the starling whole:<br />
as it beats, the heart grates her chest.</p>

<p>Rules are made for breaking the hearts<br />
of the little people. Watch the swallow:<br />
a feathered boomerang curves across the sky.</p>

<p>When the angels called, she was not at home.</p>
