  <p>"That doctor told me Frank's got maggots in his arse, Dot! What's Frank doing with maggots in his arse?"</p>

  <p>Stella had a voice that could hammer nails at a hundred paces, and a willingness to talk at anyone who came within shouting distance. From the moment his sister had arrived in the ward everything seemed, to Frank, to have changed: the pillow cupping his head had hardened, its scent shifting from shampoo lilacs to chemical chlorines; the placid knocks and clatters of the ward routines had sharpened, too, their edges less tonal, more argumentative &ndash; like a clock with an arrhythmic tick.</p>

  <p>Frank loved his baby sister, though he preferred her in small, measured doses. When he had heard the storm-front of her arrival he had quickly feigned sleep. The approaching slow-honey tones of his wife's voice was a temptation to open his eyes, smile and interact with the women who programmed his life &ndash; but the bed was comfortable and his abscess hurt less in his current position; he didn't want to disturb the maggots just yet.</p>

  <p>"It's the treatment, Stella. Haven't they explained it to you?"</p>

  <p>"You said he had boils. I laughed when I heard that one! Typical of Frankie to skive off his chores with some excuse or other, but you don't need to book into hospital to get a boil lanced. Our Mum used to make up a paste with Epsom salts: slap it on overnight and it would be popped and cured by morning! Not that I've had them, mind &ndash; a sign of not washing behind the ears, Mum said, and I've always been particular about hygiene ..."</p>

  <p>"Is he sleeping?"</p>

  <p>"I didn't want to wake him, hon. He looks so peaceful lying there &ndash; younger, like before all those wrinkles caught up with his eyes. Has he been dying his hair again?"</p>

  <p>The hand that touched Frank's shoulder was Dot's: she had a special way of touching him, a methodical stroke of fingertips that lingered on his skin, as if gently searching through his back-pelt for grubs and parasites.</p>

  <p>"So why is he here?"</p>

  <p>"It's silly really," said Dot. "You know that fence at the back of our garden?"</p>

  <p>"The one your neighbours let ivy grow over?"</p>

  <p>"That one, yes."</p>

  <p>"You should have sued them for the damages!" said Stella, the litigation hound.</p>

  <p>"Well, Frank decided to try and fix it a couple of weeks back. I told him we could get someone in to do it, but he's all for saving money since he retired. Anyway, Frank went to war with the fence, and the fence won."</p>

  <p>"He's always been clumsy, has Frank."</p>

  <p>"He ended up sat on the fence &ndash; came back indoors with a big splinter in his buttock. I fixed him up, creams and plasters, but it wouldn't heal. In the end I had to force him down to the doctor."</p>

  <p>"Squeamish, too. I remember how he would scream whenever he saw a syringe &ndash; like a banshee he was, as if it was out to kill him!"</p>

  <p>"Well, that hasn't changed," admitted his wife. The comment was almost enough to make Frank turn over and argue back; only the faint tingle in his buttock &ndash; a hint of tickling movements where once an agonizing heat had pulsed &ndash; held him back from defending his honour. He'd only screamed to scare his prim little sister, once, as a practical joke; she had been easy to frighten when they were kids.</p>

  <p>He recalled the time he'd shown her his jar of caterpillars, let her open the lid to sniff the cabbage stench of its trapped air. When he tipped one of the mint-striped worms onto her lap she ran straight into the kitchen door, gave herself a black eye. Later that day, nursing his own bruised buttocks, he'd seen tiny grubs force their way out of the remaining caterpillars, watched the little white nubs of life yawn yellow cocoons as their old homes withered across the emerald kale.</p>

  <p>Now it was his turn to host monsters. </p>

  <p>"So what's wrong with him?" asked Stella.</p>

  <p>"He's got an abscess, quite deep in fact &ndash; probably caused by an embedded splinter. The doctor gave us some antibiotics, but they didn't work. Turns out it's one of those new resistant super-bugs ..."</p>

  <p>"You mean MRSA? I've read about that."</p>

  <p>"That's its name! So here's Frank in hospital. They've discovered these flies that lay eggs on wounds, but the clever thing is the maggots only eat rotting flesh &ndash; the dead puss and stuff."</p>

  <p>"That's amazing," said Stella, "in a creepy way. Is it working?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, yes," said Dot. "He'll be coming home tomorrow. He's still got to fix that fence, you know!"
