	<p>The pool is a portrait: it captures the sky.<br />
	She reaches to stroke the stars in its depths<br />
	and fractures the world with her hand. Waves drive <br />
	and pull on the portrait that captured the sky,<br />
	a hundred new galaxies formed as they strive<br />
	to settle their bulks, to flatten their steps,<br />
	to pool a new portrait and capture the sky:<br />
	She reaches to stroke the stars in the depths.</p>
