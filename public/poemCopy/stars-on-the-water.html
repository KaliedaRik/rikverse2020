<p>The pool is a portrait: it captures the sky.<br />
She reaches to stroke the stars in its depths<br />
and fractures the world with her hand. Waves drive <br />
and pull on the portrait that captured the sky,<br />
a hundred new galaxies formed as they strive<br />
to settle their bulks, to flatten their steps,<br />
to pool a new portrait and capture the sky:<br />
She reaches to stroke the stars in the depths.</p>
