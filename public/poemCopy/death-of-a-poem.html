<p>They dragged it from its rank cell tied to a bookshelf bier, its bondage spun from old glue-spattered twine. It tried to lay flat in its frame, but the morning was dank with low cloud; jeers flapped at its long-ago turned corner, lifting it as if a salute. The plank was heavy: it parted each puddle in a wake to shod onlookers in mud. They responded with hawked spits and rancid fruits &ndash; a tatter-tape celebration of its forthcoming demise.</p>

<p>Slow was that journey, yet quickly done. It's i's widened as the wood to which it was tied stood on its end, and flew.</p>

<p>Above the crowds, space. Across the platform it could see the tortures of its demise: string; board; crayon and scissors. Declamations were made, but it didn't listen. It worried about its last words, though it knew its last words already &ndash; a good couplet, rhymed, with a brief epiphany signalled in syllables. Words and shape were its entirety: what else could there be?</p>

<p>First the hanging, pegged by its bottom margin to a washing line and pulled up, and up to where the wind could ripple its papery flesh. One of its words was 'flag', it realised. Now it was a flag, white with fright, alone since that day it had been ripped from the loving leaves of its tribe and taken to the hall of hollow echoes, for judgement. Another of its words was 'map': the map is not the thing, it knew, yet now it was.</p>

<p>Only after a severe gust tore into its flat weave was it lowered. A hand reached up and plucked it roughly from the pegs, leaving its beloved page number &ndash; eighty four &ndash; stranded in air. No time to hurl vowels to the sky. The hand screwed it to crushes before patting it flat on the board and applying brass tacks to keep it pinioned. Which colour would they use? it found itself wondering, again. An ink of classroom green was its worst fear, an analytical dissection of its form and function in front of bored kids only there for the attendance mark. It almost sighed when the fat red crayon pushed into its title to be dragged from corner to corner, bent corner to missing corner &ndash; the very X of communication.</p>

<p>The last act &ndash; the final torture whose mere fact had wormed through its fibres during the nightmare hours - was a relief when it came. This executioner was called Stanley, according to the brand stamped into its hash-grip handle. A fine blade, honed to peak perfection &ndash; the cuts that gutted lines to words, words to letters, were a lover's caress, a mother's soft stroke.</p>

<p>In the crowd below, a girl in tears recites its verse from memory. It doesn't matter. Today is a day for petals and confetti: released, it can litter the world.</p>
