<h3>Ecce Homo</h3>

<p>Harry has found a niche for the afternoon.<br />
He has furnished it in card<br />
and now houses himself<br />
beneath the starling roost<br />
close to the cathedral piazza;<br />
attempting to close away the buses<br />
churning their fumes yards from Harry's head,<br />
and hunger stammering Harry's stomach,<br />
and so sleeps.</p>

<h3>Rus in Urbe</h3>

<p>Harry coughs in his slumber, squeezing out<br />
the diesel motes trying to tarmac his lungs.<br />
The sharp hacks break the lullaby clatter<br />
of London's August siesta,<br />
distracting a mob above Harry's form<br />
from politics. They rise in purpose,<br />
a unity dabbling concretes in guano showers,<br />
and wheel their shadows across Victoria Street's<br />
pedestrian brick artwork, then settle once more.</p>

<h3>Post Harry</h3>

<p>Harry is gone. He woke to<br />
the shunting groans of London's evening stampede<br />
and has migrated to richer streets:<br />
alleys behind bakeries and takeaways,<br />
scrying cascades of bagged garbage<br />
waiting for collection day, or Harry<br />
&mdash; whichever claims them first.</p>
