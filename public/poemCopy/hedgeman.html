	<p>We wake before dawn, a welcome-mat frost laid <br />
	across the floor. We dress quietly. Break <br />
	shotguns and shells from their safe place. <br />
	Leave home with the dogs and drive <br />
	winding marsh lanes to a farm. </p>

	<p>Beside the bullock pens you meet friends,<br />
	discuss the hunt. When talk is done we shiver <br />
	away, trek across ploughed fields to find <br />
	a hide deep in a reed bed or willow thicket: <br />
	you reject several as the wide skies flush red. </p>

	<p>We settle in a wet ditch, mostly silent. Your whisper <br />
	points me to an owl, a bat. Fish waking to feed <br />
	between the reed roots. Your hand signs teach me <br />
	the rules of this, your real world: baptising me <br />
	in the mists of Romney Marsh. </p>

	<p>I stuff my hands deep into dog fur, her warm head <br />
	resting on my knee as I listen to your litany. Above us, <br />
	ducks honk their formations seaward: a few fall <br />
	to shots in the distance. You miss. I sit still, <br />
	dreaming of food, a fire. My bed.</p>
