<p>You promise me treasure, offer<br />
your body as the map that leads<br />
to riches. I search for symbols<br />
in the folds of your skin; intercept<br />
clues on tasks to perform morsed<br />
by white eye-flags, semaphored by curls<br />
and angles at the edge of your mouth.</p>

<p>Your hands challenge translations &ndash;<br />
they fly to sift through the world.<br />
I have to vector them, pin each digit<br />
with a symbol: here be dragon lairs,<br />
unicorn trails, wells of gold coin.</p>

<p>My finger sketches your face's edges,<br />
the cream henge of pegs cradled within lips.<br />
<i>'The map is not the thing'</i>, your tongue<br />
hints. But I know this &ndash; I dismiss<br />
the adipose spoils midriffing you,<br />
mere landscaping that can't disguise<br />
the designs etched in your marrow.</p>

<p>I could finish exploring this map,<br />
but instead I let you fold me tight<br />
inside your elbows, watch you build<br />
a map of me in the pits of your eyes.</p>
