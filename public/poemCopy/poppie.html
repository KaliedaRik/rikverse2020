<div aria-label="Poem body">
	<p>Within the clutter, a clay cat<br />
	with daubed blue eyes and dashed whiskers<br />
	white against the black of cold fur.</p>

	<p>I dust it routinely, knock powder<br />
	from between its ears, its paws, the crook<br />
	of its tail. It reports on my neglect.</p>

	<p>I could break it, sever the connection<br />
	of gift and receipt; let fly shelved guilts <br />
	and griefs stored in its factory smile.</p>

	<p>She is just a string of digits away,<br />
	it tells me. Pick up the purring comforter,<br />
	hold it to your cheek; click the buttons<br />
	and chat to Mother, who gave it me.</p>
