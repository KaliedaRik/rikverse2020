<p>Simnel, it breaks our Lenten fast<br />
in halves, she says, her glasses perched<br />
mid-nose, dusted in flour. A treat<br />
we make for Mothers day, all fruits<br />
and zests, sugars and spices mixed<br />
in the last of the flour we sieved for weevils,<br />
and eggs and butter churned before sunrise &mdash;<br />
now spit in the bowl, my lad, to keep<br />
the fair folks away: them buggers would sour<br />
most all of our work. See how it sticks<br />
to the spoon? Now bring us the rounded tin,<br />
then roll out that almond paste as flat<br />
as the cat your dad ran over last week<br />
and cut it in circles: two we need.<br />
Then we can pour, half over half<br />
with the ladies' fancy between the pair &mdash;<br />
though it melts in the bake, golden no more.<br />
Once that is done we top it in marchpane<br />
and toast the whole in flames to sear<br />
the tastes together. And last, we sprinkle<br />
garlands and buds to make it a treat:<br />
some petals of apple, some snowdrop hope<br />
and a twist of purple lobelia, just here,<br />
for betrayal.</p>
