	<p>Simnel, it breaks our Lenten fast<br />
	in halves, she says, her glasses perched<br />
	mid-nose, dusted in flour. A treat<br />
	we make for Mothers day, all fruits<br />
	and zests, sugars and spices mixed<br />
	in the last of the flour we sieved for weevils,<br />
	and eggs and butter churned before sunrise &ndash;<br />
	now spit in the bowl, my lad, to keep<br />
	the fair folks away: them buggers would sour<br />
	most all of our work. See how it sticks<br />
	to the spoon? Now bring us the rounded tin,<br />
	then roll out that almond paste as flat<br />
	as the cat your dad ran over last week<br />
	and cut it in circles: two we need.<br />
	Then we can pour, half over half<br />
	with the ladies' fancy between the pair &ndash;<br />
	though it melts in the bake, golden no more.<br />
	Once that is done we top it in marchpane<br />
	and toast the whole in flames to sear<br />
	the tastes together. And last, we sprinkle<br />
	garlands and buds to make it a treat:<br />
	some petals of apple, some snowdrop hope<br />
	and a twist of purple lobelia, just here,<br />
	for betrayal.</p>
