<p>This year the world around<br />
seems earlier, some weeks<br />
ahead of the earth's curve,</p>

<p>keen to get things done &ndash;<br />
buds unpacked, petals stretched<br />
and shaken dry in a cool</p>

<p>of meandered air &ndash; as if<br />
it knows the hidden plan:<br />
interesting times shall come.</p>
