	<p>She hums for Jesus as she cleans <br />
	the bath, sponges and wipes, strokes dust <br />
	from shelves and loops towels <br />
	on their proper rails. An orchid<br />
	arches in bark on the window's ledge,<br />
	straining to bloom. Soon leaves are polished<br />
	clippings trashed, and Jenny<br />
	turns her mind to sprucing herself.</p>

	<p>When she steps from her shower she towels<br />
	dribbles from her skin, takes care to wipe<br />
	the soft cloth along the lines <br />
	of her folds. Veins in her hand <br />
	arch through her skin, their net<br />
	morphing as she wipes lower, slower<br />
	to take pleasure in the scrape<br />
	of wool through white wire. Today</p>

	<p>she will call herself Maeve, and she'll<br />
	make an effort to forget the names<br />
	of her nephews and nieces. A memory<br />
	taps her cheeks, tightens her lips. When the sun<br />
	slips a beam through the window she smiles, <br />
	knuckles her puckered fingers into the cloth <br />
	and polishes, polishes until she hums:<br />
	<i>Oh Jesus please &ndash; Jesus: look away!</i></p>
