<p>The night your mum died I slunk<br />
after you to watch you cry, hiding<br />
from family, bolted in your shed<br />
at the end of the yard. Your head backlit<br />
by the bare bulb picking out tears<br />
and saltflats matched on each side<br />
of your screwed, stubbled face.</p>

<p>I cried, dad. Sobs surprised me as school<br />
gathered for lunch the day you disposed<br />
of gran. I sat, breath pressed<br />
in a chest coopered in unseen hoops.<br />
Tears shunted across my kid skin. Mates<br />
stared at my face shading red. Laughed at me,<br />
fingers pointed, and I laughed at me, too.</p>
