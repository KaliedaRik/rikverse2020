	<p>The night your mum died I slunk<br />
	after you to watch you cry, hiding<br />
	from family, bolted in your shed<br />
	at the end of the yard. Your head backlit<br />
	by the bare bulb picking out tears<br />
	and saltflats matched on each side<br />
	of your screwed, stubbled face.</p>

	<p>I cried, dad. Sobs surprised me as school<br />
	gathered for lunch the day you disposed<br />
	of gran. I sat, breath pressed<br />
	in a chest coopered in unseen hoops.<br />
	Tears shunted across my kid skin. Mates<br />
	stared at my face shading red. Laughed at me,<br />
	fingers pointed, and I laughed at me, too.</p>
