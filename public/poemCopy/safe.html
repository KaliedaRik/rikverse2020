<p>You walked in my footsteps, once in time,<br />
on Dymchurch beach; I had mudlark eyes,<br />
could spot the squirt of a razorshell<br />
at ten yards. Safe I steered us then,<br />
gust-bent in our treads over shift-sands<br />
and flotsams as the lugs spouted brine<br />
warnings: quick the tide shifts.</p>

<p>No risk, no gain &mdash; do you not understand<br />
that without you I can risk nothing?<br />
Sometimes I hate you for making me live:<br />
welt-heel, mud instep, gash-toe.</p>
