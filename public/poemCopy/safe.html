<div aria-label="Poem body">
	<p>You walked in my footsteps, once in time,<br />
	on Dymchurch beach; I had mudlark eyes,<br />
	could spot the squirt of a razorshell<br />
	at ten yards. Safe I steered us then,<br />
	gust-bent in our treads over shift-sands<br />
	and flotsams as the lugs spouted brine<br />
	warnings: quick the tide shifts.</p>

	<p>No risk, no gain &ndash; do you not understand<br />
	that without you I can risk nothing?<br />
	Sometimes I hate you for making me live:<br />
	welt-heel, mud instep, gash-toe.</p>
