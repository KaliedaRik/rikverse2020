	<p>I was on the losing end of three hands<br />
	of duff cards; each round a waste<br />
	of good cash after better. The line<br />
	of table chatter was stacking words<br />
	towards my exit: the struts of a door<br />
	and my shadow through it, walking away.</p>

	<p>Perhaps the cut of my suit scared away<br />
	some guardian angels. The deft hands<br />
	that re-fizz my gin are yours, door<br />
	keepers for happier places. We waste<br />
	a glance between us, eye-white words<br />
	feeding each other the pickup line.</p>

	<p>You breathe in my ear: "I can line<br />
	you up with something stronger, away<br />
	from the tables, yes?" Easy words<br />
	to your blood-wine lips, easy like hands<br />
	in a pocket tapping on change. I waste<br />
	no time, ditch the game. The door</p>

	<p>mule-kicks back at my push; your door<br />
	swivels easy on its hinge. A tight line<br />
	of lights marks the shore &ndash; we waste<br />
	a moment to draw in salt air. Then away<br />
	to a different land, jungle hot: hands<br />
	meshed as tight as mosquito nets; words</p>

	<p>possum-still as if hunted by jaguar; words<br />
	hurled from stormy lungs. When the door<br />
	clicks open, again, when strange hands<br />
	grab at my limbs, when a hemp line<br />
	tightens at my neck I am already away &ndash;<br />
	lost within some wormwood waste.</p>

	<p>"Who are you?" Your probe is a waste<br />
	of our time: who am I? A set of words,<br />
	nothing more; a gambler, a drunk away<br />
	from his righteous wagon, a door<br />
	pusher, a grifter quick with a line;<br />
	a man who sees futures in many hands.</p>

	<p>A rustle of hands picking through your waste;<br />
	a click on your phone line &ndash; who hears your words?<br />
	I'll knock on your door and take you away &hellip;</p>
