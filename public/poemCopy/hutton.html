	<p>Now the fair Lord has parsed the story's text and let<br />
	the peasants view his judgement. Kelly is dead, the hand<br />
	that slashed is still, no shame of mind for a man who set<br />
	the story right, who barked at giants, stalked the lands<br />
	of Ur and Muscovy for sight or sign of death<br />
	in tubes of flame. Who teased the facts from steppes and sand<br />
	and set them down in statements sought by princes, truth<br />
	pinned down and bound. A wholesome work by a trusted man.</p>

	<p>Watching the lord as he mouthed his words of silk<br />
	I feel we've lost &ndash; the facts are spinning apart<br />
	already, clipped in soundbites, highlights flashed<br />
	across the globe in headlines, bullpoints: feel<br />
	the story crash across the newsdesks, spurt<br />
	in columns inching from the op-eds to the trash.</p>
