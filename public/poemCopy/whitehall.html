<p class='epigraph'><i>"A fire destroyed Whitehall, the largest and ugliest palace in Europe"</i><br />
Duc de Saint-Simon, 1698</p>

<p>When I walk drunk through Saint James's Park<br />
late, late at night I can smell the flames.</p>

<p>There was a map of this palace, but it burned<br />
with the Dutch maid who fired her master's bed.</p>

<p>The ambassador kept an office above a room<br />
where pigs were stalled; they paid a better rent.</p>

<p>I see these things when I'm drunk in Whitehall,<br />
walking straight within the machine gun's sights.</p>

<p>Ghosts pack this street like grenades in a box:<br />
horses trot through taxis soliciting trade.</p>

<p>I wave to Guido. He's waiting to be strung up<br />
and disembowelled. Charles shakes in the cold air.</p>

<p>Still the starling cloud wheels, their parliament<br />
an exercise in precision, beauty and noise.</p>
