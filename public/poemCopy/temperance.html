	<p>Winter Sundays are the best time. I rise<br />
	out of bed with the smell of burning bacon<br />
	and twitch my passage through the day by smells.</p>

	<p>Music floods the house. Mum tunes her ears to easy listening <br />
	radio, sets her hands to dicing carrots, peeling taters.<br />
	Dressed, I hide in books, chasing bookworms</p>

	<p>across the pages of fantasies and monsters. Gusts of iced<br />
	air alert my back to the open and close of the front door,<br />
	tracking your departure to set England right with friends in pubs</p>

	<p>and the arrival of neighbours who pop by for the gossip,<br />
	sharing mugs of tea with mum as she stuffs the chicken<br />
	with sage and onion, crumbles the stock cube into oil,</p>

	<p>rips cabbages into pots. They soon steam, heating<br />
	the atmosphere, gauzing the windows in a fine mist:<br />
	I break from picture books to finger-sketch</p>

	<p>on the panes: stick models, happy families. In time<br />
	the cooking is completed. Plates are heaped with meat<br />
	and greens, fed back into the oven to keep warm.</p>

	<p>The family arrives back in drabs, to be sat at the table<br />
	for the weekly ritual. My brothers joke, make bets<br />
	on your behaviour. You will soon be back home,</p>

	<p>determined to sit at the head of the feast, act<br />
	the part of Dad when the blue pills balance your brain.<br />
	Or dangerous entertainer, if the kilter is bad.</p>
