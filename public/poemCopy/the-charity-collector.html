<p>She stands in the wind with a tin in her mittens <br />
and calls for donations &mdash; some coppers will do. <br />
Shy shoppers are caught with their purses mid-pocket: <br />
they clatter their change in the pot and move on. <br />
Though eyes will exchange a brief lock of compassion, <br />
the gale is too chill to allow a quick word <br />
and somehow the act doesn't mend the impressions <br />
that photos of children in rows in a pit <br />
have lodged in our heads. But still that tin rattles, <br />
now loud as I put my bare hand on loose change <br />
and add to her pile. Her smile is infectious: <br />
a spread of the lips to reveal crooked teeth <br />
that tell me that though we can't stop the tsunamis <br />
we still change the world with a copper or two.</p>
