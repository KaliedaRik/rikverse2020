<p>She stands in the wind with a tin in her mittens<br />
and calls for donations &ndash; some coppers will do.<br />
Shy shoppers are caught with their purses mid-pocket:<br />
they clatter their change in the pot and move on.<br />
Though eyes will exchange a brief lock of compassion,<br />
the gale is too chill to allow a quick word<br />
and somehow the act doesn't mend the impressions<br />
that photos of children in rows in a pit<br />
have lodged in our heads. But still that tin rattles,<br />
now loud as I put my bare hand on loose change<br />
and add to her pile. Her smile is infectious:<br />
a spread of the lips to reveal crooked teeth<br />
that tell me that though we can't stop the tsunamis<br />
we still change the world with a copper or two.</p>
