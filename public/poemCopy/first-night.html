<p>It was your eyes that sobered me: ice<br />
at the end of the world; the ghost of a fox<br />
staring down his hare across the tundra;</p>

<p>a chilled air vaulting through the sweat<br />
of men as they drank, posed, assessed. That glance<br />
of shivered blue left me feral. I was in the bar</p>

<p>and then I was in the bar with you. When<br />
you passed me lager, I spied ice-flake glints<br />
on your dew claw. We danced, I think</p>

<p>we danced; or possibly you stalked my tracks<br />
through the snows of our private ecology &ndash;<br />
new ground frozen from the polar seas.</p>
