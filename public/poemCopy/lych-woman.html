<p>They hoist old Grandad Clegg<br />
across the stiles and down<br />
the track feet first, their arms<br />
a sheen of moonlight joined<br />
around his final box.</p>

<p>Eyes closed, she sees parades<br />
not yet come along the road,<br />
each witnessing a source<br />
of strength. The bench beneath<br />
the churchyard gate is damp<br />
against her legs, now numb<br />
from sitting still as a ghost.</p>

<p>Old Clegg was good for the gossip<br />
shared over steepened tea &mdash;<br />
she'll miss his smutty wisdom<br />
when he pops his clogs, she thinks.</p>

<p>There's more to view: A coffin<br />
tops the hill, so small<br />
a man can lug it alone.<br />
Her John was four when Jesus<br />
called him back home one day,<br />
an autumn drowning. Thumbs<br />
of fog massage her shoulders,<br />
ease her sticking joints.</p>

<p>The last to pass is fuzzy &mdash;<br />
just a shape of muddy light<br />
above the path. A voice<br />
long buried hints in her ear:<br />
<i>'&hellip; a crate for her who waits.'</i></p>
