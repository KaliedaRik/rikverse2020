	<p>They hoist old Grandad Clegg<br />
	across the stiles and down<br />
	the track feet first, their arms<br />
	a sheen of moonlight joined<br />
	around his final box.</p>

	<p>Eyes closed, she sees parades<br />
	not yet come along the road,<br />
	each witnessing a source<br />
	of strength. The bench beneath<br />
	the churchyard gate is damp<br />
	against her legs, now numb<br />
	from sitting still as a ghost.</p>

	<p>Old Clegg was good for the gossip<br />
	shared over steepened tea &ndash;<br />
	she'll miss his smutty wisdom<br />
	when he pops his clogs, she thinks.</p>

	<p>There's more to view: A coffin<br />
	tops the hill, so small<br />
	a man can lug it alone.<br />
	Her John was four when Jesus<br />
	called him back home one day,<br />
	an autumn drowning. Thumbs<br />
	of fog massage her shoulders,<br />
	ease her sticking joints.</p>

	<p>The last to pass is fuzzy &ndash;<br />
	just a shape of muddy light<br />
	above the path. A voice<br />
	long buried hints in her ear:<br />
	<i>'&hellip; a crate for her who waits.'</i></p>
