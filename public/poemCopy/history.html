<p>Here lies the portrait of a woman long lost:<br />
the chin juts a touch too far, the hands<br />
fold neatly on starch-pleats<br />
of the sweeping summer-Sunday skirts.</p>

<p>She is intelligent: a stare crosses glass<br />
to puncture masks. The thin smile<br />
acknowledges my presence. I am read<br />
&ndash; un-judged &ndash; by a photograph developed<br />
with old alchemies, by human hands<br />
as much now dust<br />
as the skim on the frame.</p>

<p>I think I know you, woman.<br />
I don't know your name, but your blood<br />
clots my healing scabs. Dressed cheeks<br />
shape your face into prosaic folds:<br />
your smile appears now in current scenes.<br />
Familiar history is failed in this age;<br />
I do not need it. I have your eyes.</p>
