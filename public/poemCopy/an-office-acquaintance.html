<p>He said: <span aria-label="speaker: friend" class="spoken-fragment">"love is<br />
a sport of both skill<br />
and chance, strategic<br />
planning must become your<br />
core competence."</span></p>

<p>I said: <span aria-label="speaker: narrator" class="spoken-fragment">"why render these chemicals<br />
into a game?"</span></p>

<p>He said: <span aria-label="speaker: friend" class="spoken-fragment">"you have to<br />
compete, my friend."</span></p>

<p>I said: nothing. I watched his teeth<br />
moisten his underlip, a quick slither<br />
of spittle between words to gloss<br />
his pursed 'you'. He smelt of sharp spices.<br />
I watched him cock his head, his gaze<br />
remained symmetrical, blue &ndash; electrodes<br />
clipped onto my eyes. I caught<br />
his throat form thoughts &ndash; a rhythmic<br />
rise and close, rise and close.<br />
Curled hairs caressed his larynx<br />
&ndash; as should my tongue?</p>

<p>He said, oh, something<br />
or other. I was beyond<br />
the listening.</p>
