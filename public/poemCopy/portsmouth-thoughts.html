<p>With the marksman's lead threaded<br />
in his spine, they took him down<br />
to settle in the rocking dark, alert<br />
to the cracks of battle: splinter spars;<br />
powder pillows heft from copper store<br />
to cannon; sharp wine in water; shouts;<br />
sweats. He bled in his ship of skin,<br />
three hours to reach death's dock.</p>

<p>Another man has no plaque, nor grave<br />
beyond a weight of water. He has instead<br />
a glass display, labels to mark him:<br />
<i>'barber-surgeon drowned with his chest.'</i><br />
Here are his knives, his herbs, a leather<br />
of shoe, some dice, some coins, a bone<br />
nit-comb. He has no face; his blood<br />
rusts in Solent muds. Still he was here.</p>

<p>This boat is all lignin bone in mist,<br />
a preservation of what was once great,<br />
and lost, and rescued. I pay good coin<br />
to view her &mdash; for she is my history<br />
as much as the bricks and stones<br />
of the town surrounding us, the heroes<br />
who watched these docks slip past,<br />
a clinch in our tide's slow pulse.</p>
