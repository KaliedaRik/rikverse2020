	<p>My weighted basket<br />
	is a stoutly woven<br />
	wicker affair, arch<br />
	handle stiff to hand.</p>

	<p>The nation's basket<br />
	holds supermarket shelves<br />
	in its lidless recess;<br />
	hauliers, factory farms,<br />
	jovial hatless actuaries &ndash;<br />
	the decimal remnants<br />
	of nuclear families,<br />
	their wages average<br />
	by gender, their houses<br />
	mortgaged on lease.</p>

	<p>My accessorised basket<br />
	is better, as befits<br />
	the consumer talents<br />
	of a pound-pinked man.<br />
	Lifestyle wordsmiths<br />
	disagree: it needs<br />
	a coordinated cloth<br />
	to cap it, they tell me,<br />
	a time-limited choice<br />
	of single-colour swatches<br />
	on sale in May.</p>
