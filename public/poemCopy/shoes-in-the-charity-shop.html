<p aria-label="Epigraph" class='epigraph'><i>"Es verdad que lo ignoro todo sobre el."</i><br />
Borges, 'Isidoro Acevedo'</p>

<p>Like a stack of footfalls they pile in tangles<br />
against the creamy walls &ndash; that terra incognita<br />
waiting for the first tread: a dotted lozenge<br />
of an open-toe stiletto sole; an angled maze<br />
of old work boot; the swirls of logoed trainer.</p>

<p>My jumble of shoes sit in their carrier,<br />
quiet as the shy child in the new school<br />
abandoned to his fate by those he trusts.<br />
Behind the counter, a woman, perked in pink<br />
and the sweet sweat smells of abandonment.</p>

<p>I want to say: look after them, as they<br />
looked after me running for buses, stood<br />
in queues, parked within desk-ceilinged caves.<br />
This shoe caught the eye of one I came<br />
to love; that boot chewed my heel to blood.</p>

<p>And yet do I know the secret lives of those<br />
who shod me? Perhaps they plot and plan<br />
incarcerations, the separation of ball<br />
and arch from the polite societies of ant<br />
and stump. <i>Quis custodiet custodiam?</i></p>
