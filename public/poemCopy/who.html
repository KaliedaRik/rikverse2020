	<p>My book has moved again, the edge of pens<br />
	I placed around it undisturbed, its leaves<br />
	flicked by some hand or gust just as I glanced<br />
	away &ndash; who tricks a mind this way? That page<br />
	of silent faces drew a scene from me<br />
	in some elsewhere, a second's glimpse, no more,<br />
	and what was there before me shifted. Ghosts?</p>

	<p>My room seems stable &ndash; walls and carpets all<br />
	in place, their weaves and paints remembered right.<br />
	The window blind is up, and still; the road<br />
	outside seems bright and warm, its cars a chain<br />
	of chromes and dents and rusts. Pedestrians<br />
	ignore my unblinked stare. The clock says five &ndash;<br />
	it should be half gone three ... my time has moved</p>

	<p>again! The man who comes to wipe my sores<br />
	is back today, his whistled tune a grace<br />
	of noise to take the ticks of lying clocks<br />
	from ears that used to work. I used to work.<br />
	This flesh is not my flesh; this skin I wear<br />
	is nothing more than wrinkled sunshine. Who<br />
	took that old book of grinning lives from me?</p>
