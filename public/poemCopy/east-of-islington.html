<h3>1. Cannonbury</h3>

<p>Half-six of an evening and already <br />
the paving has been crisped smooth, <br />
no stone, no ledge has been spared <br />
its Dickens-winter decoration. <br />
Shuffling unbalanced left and right <br />
I chuff my way home, trailing <br />
exhalations behind me. </p>

<h3>2. Essex Road</h3>

<p>Some shops remain open, huddled <br />
within their festive gear. Like candles <br />
and moths they beggar my reflexes &ndash; <br />
<i>Enter,</i> they carol-chant my cash. <i>Spend. </i> <br />
Brittle, I walk on, fearful of falling <br />
if I should take a wrong step <br />
away from the track to my door. </p>

<h3>3. Northchurch</h3>

<p>The cars in Northchurch Road <br />
squat by their kerbs, henges in shadows. <br />
Jack-the-Lad has beaten me here, riming <br />
each car window with a glittery glaze. <br />
Stopping, I try to sign <br />
a frosted screen, but my hands <br />
are un-gloved: my fingers stick.</p>
