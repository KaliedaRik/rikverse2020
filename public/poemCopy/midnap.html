<p>Be warned, I keep this dreamhouse<br />
sparse &mdash; kitchen, bedroom, lounge:<br />
no space for broom or store. We pit<br />
spoor in a yard with face-mixed friends.</p>

<p>To each room, an altar &mdash; to hope,<br />
to growth, to you. Aside a bed a steam<br />
of steeped assam, a clip of bleach-frayed<br />
punk spike; across a sofa's curves a match<br />
of lobe-woven lungs, that shared air<br />
a safe dock for fond, blood warm words.</p>

<p>A galley pan upon the flame; a sweat<br />
of nettles in broth, their weal inks drawn<br />
and spiced like us by fresh starts: hug to me<br />
tight, my love, while I wake.</p>
