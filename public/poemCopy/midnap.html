<div aria-label="Poem body">
	<p>Be warned, I keep this dreamhouse<br />
	sparse &ndash; kitchen, bedroom, lounge:<br />
	no space for broom or store. We pit<br />
	spoor in a yard with face-mixed friends.</p>

	<p>To each room, an altar &ndash; to hope,<br />
	to growth, to you. Aside a bed a steam<br />
	of steeped assam, a clip of bleach-frayed<br />
	punk spike; across a sofa's curves a match<br />
	of lobe-woven lungs, that shared air<br />
	a safe dock for fond, blood warm words.</p>

	<p>A galley pan upon the flame; a sweat<br />
	of nettles in broth, their weal inks drawn<br />
	and spiced like us by fresh starts: hug to me<br />
	tight, my love, while I wake.</p>
