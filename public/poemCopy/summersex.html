<p>We step barefoot across the still-wet humps<br />
of Dymchurch beach, its moonlit streams an etch<br />
of curves connecting each abandoned stretch<br />
of sea back home. I catch your hand, my thumb<br />
a chat-up telegraph of taps and strokes &ndash;<br />
two strangers newly met at the party fires,<br />
shared beers and jokes beneath the stars; desires<br />
like this are best kept secret from our folks.</p>

<p>And after &ndash; after grit and groan and sweat<br />
and lick amid the leathery strands of kelp &ndash;<br />
I find a mermaid's purse among the threads<br />
of nets and cans, the dog inside un-whelped.<br />
You gift me one last kiss, a whisper: <i>"tide's<br />
about to turn &ndash; I'll see you round sometime."</i></p>
