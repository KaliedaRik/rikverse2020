<p class="epigraph">(After the 'Elinor of Aquitaine' Sassanid vase, Louvre, Paris)</p>

<p>Within its clear lattice, a history of hands:<br />
bent men in deep places, mining rock veins.</p>

<p>Some artisan smooths, hollows its crystal jag;<br />
in the drill of his vision he touches his God.</p>

<p>Honeycombs dent fingers wrapped in weaves to sip<br />
wine from its neck. Hand to hand, to hand. Poor Eleanor,</p>

<p>orphaned, traded, lifts it to her prince; radiant<br />
candlelight glints from its new golden flue.</p>

<p>Hands slap to heads: it cracks on a museum floor -<br />
a fresh fretwork to celebrate its timeless tale.</p>
