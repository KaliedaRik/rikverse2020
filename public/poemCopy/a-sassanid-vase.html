		<p class="level-with-top">Within its clear lattice, a history of hands:<br />
		bent men in deep places, mining rock veins.</p>

		<p>Some artisan smooths, hollows its crystal jag;<br />
		in the drill of his vision he touches his God.</p>

		<p>Honeycombs dent fingers wrapped in weaves to sip<br />
		wine from its neck. Hand to hand, to hand. Poor Eleanor,</p>

		<p>orphaned, traded, lifts it to her prince; radiant<br />
		candlelight glints from its new golden flue.</p>

		<p>Hands slap to heads: it cracks on a museum floor -<br />
		a fresh fretwork to celebrate its timeless tale.</p>
