The quazikov can score you points
        when placed upon the board,
        but challenges come thick and fast
        from people poorly taught
about the beasts of Barkonleigh
        that roam around at night
        and eat the fruit of gamgam trees
        while staying out of sight.

The trial of Lingus Mascabee
        took sixteen days and nights:
        the prosecuter told the tale
        of robbers wearing tights;
then Lingus stood and showed the court
        it wasn't him because
        he only had one leg &ndash; and that
        was close to being lost.

Twenty men climbed up the hill
        to court the Maids of Skip &ndash;
        they read them screeds of poetry,
        they fed them meruslip;
they led them by the hands on walks
        across the cabbage fields
        where the Maids of Skip stabbed the men
        and burned them with their shields.

This football game is boring us:
        we want to see some skills!
        We want to see the home team score
        a barrow-load of goals!
We want to see the referee
        regain his mind and sight
        and then we want to drink some beer
        and sing and puke and fight!

Malley was a carpenter:
        he built himself a chair
        and set it up upon his roof
        where he could sit and stare
at people rushing to and fro
        with screams and cries of fear
        while Malley shot them with his gun
        and lanced them with his spear.
