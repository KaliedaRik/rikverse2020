<p>A man asked me today: <i>did you ever<br />
love him?</i> And I had to, to think ...</p>

<p>Perhaps when I was young and clever<br />
I found space in my heart for one<br />
whose stories echoed through decades &ndash;<br />
a hero of sorts, a brother who<br />
came here to an earth ripe with promise<br />
and penance. Tales he gave us, ways<br />
made fit for those who despaired of fitting<br />
their wrecked lives to some norm beyond<br />
the reach of their kibbled coins. A holy,<br />
deserving man of the lord come<br />
to deliver riches and solace: loving<br />
each other the key to joy &ndash; <i>did I<br />
ever love him?</i> Where others saw angels<br />
I saw a book full of old words<br />
and angels were harsh fairies with trumpets<br />
and wings too big for their, their frocks ...</p>

<p>They nailed him hard to wood, poor bastard,<br />
then bowed to his tattered meat &ndash; if that<br />
is love, then no: I refuse to worship<br />
a butchered corpse, the ghost it hatched<br />
or any lie his, his acolytes created ...</p>

<p>Some people say he lives again,<br />
that this is the promised time of raptures:<br />
ungather us from evil men<br />
indeed! Yet others whisper: he rages<br />
and sobs and screams at what we've done,<br />
become in his name. Seek out this spirit<br />
fleshed again against his will<br />
and stop him before he shatters the heavens<br />
and peels the clouds to cleanse the world<br />
in lightning and ice. People are hatreds &ndash;<br />
now there is a love I understand,<br />
for sin is my heart, my joy and my comfort,<br />
my wealth and hearth, solace and, and lust ...</p>

<p>To the man who spoke to me this morning:<br />
<i>I'm sure when we meet, our love shall burn!</i></p>
