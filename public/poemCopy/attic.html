<p>It takes more than a ladder<br />
to reach the cocoon that sits<br />
atop the bricks of her life. <br />
"Careful! Don't fall on the dog!"</p>

<p>She panics too much: we are<br />
not here to steal her history. <br />
Rather we pack it and force it<br />
through the wood-rimmed hole &ndash; <br />
the suitcase that carried <br />
her life-goods to England;<br />
the suit she married; coats<br />
still in their wrap, bought<br />
on a payday whim. "He knows,"</p>

<p>she tells us, "he doesn't like<br />
change." The guard he left behind<br />
to keep her &ndash; a moment's purchase <br />
a week before his last breath &ndash; <br />
watches us strain-sweat-shove<br />
the last vacuum-sucked packet<br />
out of sight. "Grrr," I throat<br />
back at her tongue-lolled yaps:<br />
she smacks her cable-thick tail<br />
on the carpet like a dare.</p>
