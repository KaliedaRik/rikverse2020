<p>I cannot sing for you, my cat:<br />
my throat is poorly shaped for song<br />
and words get stuck behind the plumb<br />
that swings above my tongue. But then<br />
your voice was rarely raised, my cat:<br />
I thought you were a statue kept<br />
beside the fridge, so scared to move<br />
in case some two-leg freak returned<br />
to bag you, bin you. Yet a cat<br />
can overcome &ndash; you always sought<br />
the sun to russet up your fur,<br />
the warmth of quiet fuss: no need<br />
to entertain your hosts, my cat,<br />
by chasing ropes or catching birds;<br />
just sit, and eat, and sometimes purr<br />
when watching from the kitchen shelf.</p>
