Into the left eye     shimmers a desert
complete horizons  &ndash;  granuled  aridity
clean           sterile            pure



Into the right orb shiver contingencies
    cold     cramp space duty    food
  emotion    inanition   inertia 
       order rupture leisure sex   shit
heart    death        beer     sweat
    sweat heat    sex death



On a grey morning     On a cold morning
        &lt;&ndash;  On this morning  &ndash;&gt;

it could be simple to pluck the
                              right eye
     from this head, let the blood
                                stumble
     from this socket, allow scabs to
                                   drag
     over this cheek, bring a desert
                              back home
