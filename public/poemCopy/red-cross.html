<p>I met you first on the back of a boot boy,<br />
shaved skull and dirty mouth, defender</p>

<p>of a homeland born in chants on terraces.<br />
An old soldier's signal left in the dole queue</p>

<p>when brighter banners were hoisted high.<br />
The gutter shills have your history wrong &ndash;</p>

<p>the dragons you slayed were penny-scraping<br />
and moat-digging; hates replaced by hugs</p>

<p>even for the skinhead who believed the lies<br />
whispered in stadiums: England expects &hellips;</p>
