<div aria-label="Poem body">
	<p>The savageness takes me as I step through the door:<br />
	what was once my street is recast as a chill desolation.<br />
	Cars are gone, walls hidden. Trees shiver<br />
	in the sneezy gusts of a diseased gale.<br />
	Ice has mastered the air: continues to fall<br />
	in clumps and sputters as I shiver my way into town.</p>

	<p>On the bus it looks serene. A beautiful death to view.<br />
	December has whitewashed the town, driven<br />
	the city's scars beneath an eiderdown of snow.<br />
	Executives walk to offices with smiles iced to their cheeks<br />
	while youngsters romp and tourists click-record<br />
	this rarest of London's many shows.</p>

	<p>Yet I scowl as I slip-shuffle my final leg to work.<br />
	I am not convinced. All I see are drifts of purity, a city<br />
	coerced into a glorious uniformity that feeds my unease.<br />
	I know winter's order will not last a thousand years: still I ache<br />
	for a crocus rebellion to smash this frozen state, to<br />
	riot through my head and kick my sap awake.</p>
