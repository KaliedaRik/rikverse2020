<div aria-label="Poem body" data-form="Sonnet">
	<p>The Martello gun points to France, a long<br />
	sleek defiance, and I astride its breech.<br />
	Nothing in this ribbon village can top<br />
	its crumbling guard: from this roof I can see<br />
	the curving line of dressed wall, built to deny<br />
	a tide whose storm blown high mark would bury<br />
	my own birth-spot in four feet of cold brine.<br />
	Dymchurch straggles alongside, a heavy<br />
	traffic clotting the High Street. I ignore<br />
	it all. Fix instead on your home, a van<br />
	in a field past which the toy-town trains roar.<br />
	I want to turn this cannon to the land.<br />
	Aim at the road, the shops, fairgrounds and fire:<br />
	level and clear. Heal. I have you in my sights.</p>
