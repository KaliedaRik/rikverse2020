<p>Sophie's Dad wants to talk to her.<br />
He rattles the windows<br />
as he loiters amid the gales of God's farts.<br />
Sophie is alone: her real friends<br />
on the radio like to keep her company.<br />
Sophie is lonely tonight.</p>

<p>Sophie knows he is there:<br />
he rattles the unwashed crockery<br />
as he climbs the plumbing to the bedsit sink.<br />
He wants to talk to her.<br />
Sophie is not scared: she fetches some candles &mdash;<br />
Sophie will play the ouija.</p>

<p>After chalking big letters, rounded,<br />
circling across the plywood board;<br />
after carefully taunting life<br />
into the two fat, candle-wax stubs,<br />
she silences her real friends<br />
and gutters the bare bulb screwed to the ceiling.<br />
She places two fingers &mdash; left and right &mdash;<br />
each side of the tupperware tumbler<br />
and smiles: <i>hello, Dad.</i></p>

<p>It moves.</p>

<p>Slowly at first, unsure of the letters.<br />
Clearing its throat, circling the plywood,<br />
scraping the plastic cup with leisure.</p>

<p>The ouija speaks: <i>bich</i> it spells.<br />
<i>fuking slag</i><br />
<i>hore</i> &mdash; Sophie giggles.<br />
Dad wants to play some games with her,<br />
but he cannot. Not now.</p>

<p>The spelling becomes more scattered.<br />
The beaker moves faster:<br />
chalk dust rises as the angry cup rushes<br />
from letter to letter, dictating<br />
obscenities. Then</p>

<p>the tupperware is hurled across the room.<br />
It bounces from wall to wall before<br />
dropping from the floor inert once more.<br />
Sophie screams and claps her hands:<br />
Dad is much more fun now he is</p>

<p>dead. The candle flames are guttered out.<br />
Wax gobbets smear onto window panes.<br />
The crockery rattles scab-dried remnants free<br />
and curtains romp in their flapping rage. Sophie</p>

<p>lifts her skirt. <i>Daddy! Look!</i> Deft fingers<br />
caress and knead and weave and rub and<br />
swell her Janet to pleasure red &mdash;</p>

<p>it stills.</p>

<p>Sophie turns her radio on.<br />
Her real friends like to keep her company.<br />
Sophie loves her radio.</p>
