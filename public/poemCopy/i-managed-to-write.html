<p>Arthur still sleeps<br />
somewhere rock deep<br />
while the world shatters<br />
about me. What matters<br />
must I care for today?<br />
The madmen at play<br />
in a gilt city set<br />
on its hill; or the spittle wet<br />
brays honed in the gobs<br />
of suit smart yobs<br />
keen for my vote? No.<br />
Today I shall care for those<br />
who count pennies for payments &ndash;<br />
each story a fresh resentment<br />
I can knot my rug of rage:<br />
that in this, our richest age<br />
some must still starve<br />
so others can carve<br />
delights from delusions,<br />
lives from illusions<br />
&ndash; like this rich mat I have made,<br />
now tight trimmed and laid<br />
ahead of my alter, and me<br />
on my knees at prayer. See<br />
me beg for Arthur's release:<br />
only in wishes hides my peace.</p>
