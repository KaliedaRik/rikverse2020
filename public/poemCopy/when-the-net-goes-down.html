<div aria-label="Poem body">
	<p>Blue sky at noon: deep, smooth, no clutter <br />
	of cloud to stall the fall of filtered sun &ndash; <br />
	an accountant kicks her shoes from her heels, <br />
	pivots tired eyes from her frozen screen </p>

	<p>to dream: pillow dens for her childcared boy.<br />
	Around her the chatter gathers, a growl <br />
	of irritations &ndash; deadlines missed, reports <br />
	lost: each spendthrift second sours the holy </p>

	<p>Profit. The man who nests at the desk opposite<br />
	offers a smile, an introduction of sorts. <br />
	She would stall his words but etiquette requires <br />
	an answer from her: a name; a sympathy nod</p>

	<p>as he lists the wrongs heaped in his in-tray. <br />
	She knows he cannot hear her words nor spy<br />
	the child inside her eyes who fights dragons <br />
	with cushions and battens and hope.</p>
