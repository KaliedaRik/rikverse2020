<p class="epigraph">(After Federico Garc√≠a Lorca's <a href="https://es.wikisource.org/wiki/El_poeta_pide_a_su_amor_que_le_escriba">El poeta pide a su amor que le escriba</a>)</p>

<p>My bowel-nested love, my death in life,<br />
a long-drawn time I wait for your new words<br />
and think, beside the bloom now past its peak,<br />
if life excludes the me &ndash; you, I want to lose.</p>

<p>The air does not exclude. The lifeless stone<br />
it has no track of shade, no will to hide.<br />
The pulse that moves all hearts, it does not seek<br />
the frozen honey spills the moon pours forth.</p>

<p>And yet you, I have suffered: ripped my veins,<br />
a tiger and dove together, your waist<br />
held for a sharp-edged fight of bites and lilies.</p>

<p>So come, now: make my madness full with words<br />
or let me live each thought in my serene<br />
and shuttered universe; my bones, my night.</p>
