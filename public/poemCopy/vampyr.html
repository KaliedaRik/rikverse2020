<p>Dogs have knocked the coffin down <br />
to the ground in search of his bones. <br />
While the lid holds, the last slants <br />
of the ebbing sun catch his face <br />
through dry-rot panels, rashing his skin. </p>

<p>Nightfall. He unhooks the security latch <br />
and levers the squealing lid open, <br />
winces, then stretches. Checks the room <br />
for stakes and stakeholders. Stands <br />
and shakes the soil from his cloak. </p>

<p>Sun-lick has singed his cheeks, hatcheting <br />
across forgotten laughter ley-lines. <br />
By touch, he applies a white foundation, <br />
thick, panning his visage. A cherry lip-gloss <br />
soothes his parchment lips. Fangs are flossed. </p>

<p>Beyond ablutions, he breathes deep and takes <br />
the shape of Wolf. Calling the hounds of hell <br />
to heel, he leaves his tumbledown crypt and pads <br />
through municipal burial fields. Aims for the edge <br />
of town and the cultivated deserts beyond. </p>

<p>Food is scarce in these declining decades. <br />
Beef and long-pork are both contaminated prey. <br />
He settles for short-pork, ripping the pig <br />
before it can scream, tossing torn haunches <br />
to his black pack. He gulps ruby fluid. Unglamorous, </p>

<p>yet safe. Leaving the factory farm, a glance <br />
of moonlight shivers his spine. He checks for cats <br />
before shaking his form into gargoyle faced bat. Takes <br />
wing across wheat fields, arcs across pearl clouds. <br />
Watches farmhands wreck profits with circles in corn.</p>
