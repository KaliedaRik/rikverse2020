	<p>Guns do not rattle. They punch through bones<br />
	to jack a shoulder back, a wrestler keen to wrench<br />
	joints apart, then whisper: I have made you God.</p>

	<p>He says to me: <i>"Happy is He who repays you for <br />
	what you have done to us; He who gathers up <br />
	your infants and dashes them against the rocks."</i></p>

	<p>I have no gun, nor son, nor daughter to place<br />
	upon this city's pyres. All I have is a ragged prophet,<br />
	a fist around an empty bottle, and some dry eyes.</p>

	<p>My questions are not bullets to shatter facts<br />
	from faces. I let the air escaping my tongue<br />
	wash the dirt from the old man's despair: where</p>

	<p>and when, and who told you this, and that, and<br />
	'I have another jar of the good juice for a guy<br />
	who has the know of passing whispers to his friends.'</p>

	<p>He jerks his chicken-thin neck like a jailbird dodging<br />
	the noose: <i>"Yes, oh yes; the words of a whisperer <br />
	are like dainty morsels. I can set that table for you."</i></p>
