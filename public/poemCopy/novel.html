<p>The last word typed, I thank<br />
my characters. <i>No problem,</i></p>

<p>says one as it plucks away<br />
a face and wipes clean</p>

<p>its head. <i>We are always happy<br />
to help birth a new story.</i></p>

<p>Already I see a sketch of webs<br />
I could lay on their shapes &ndash;</p>

<p>these dolls who halter my text<br />
and make eyes skip through scenes.</p>

<p><i>I believe you know the way<br />
out,</i> the faceless one adds.</p>
