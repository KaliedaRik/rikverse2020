	<p>He is a cold witness, as chill<br />
	as a slip of rime on the lip<br />
	of a crisp new beer. For weeks</p>

	<p>I chased his rumour, sharp alleys<br />
	un-vexed by daylight, garbage<br />
	mansions bearding freeway struts.</p>

	<p>This shade sits easy in my office,<br />
	his lids half-cupped as eyes check<br />
	evidence stacks for entertainments.</p>

	<p><i>"The whisper is you want some words."</i></p>

	<p>My list of questions is as long<br />
	as the walk to the liquor store,<br />
	but the one I choose is short: why?</p>

	<p><i>"Who asks?"</i> As he tilts his head<br />
	to scratch his beard I spot hemp-weave<br />
	patterns scorched deep in his neck.</p>

	<p>My stare flicks to the desk where lies<br />
	a Gideons, liberated from its hotel<br />
	drawer by the woman who hired me.</p>

	<p><i>"I choked, and yet I breathe again."</i></p>

	<p>His smile is quick and sad, a crack<br />
	of tooth between louse-lush fuzz ruddied<br />
	by the slant guttering of the sun.</p>

	<p>I tell him of visions. I tell him<br />
	that night follows day and histories<br />
	walk the city's baked streets.</p>

	<p><i>"He told me to do it."</i> he says.<br />
	<i>"Anyone can get their hands and heels<br />
	nailed to some planks of wood!"</i></p>

	<p>His face whips close: I catch rust webs<br />
	of bust veins etched on eye-whites &ndash;<br />
	his lung-dust stills my tongue.</p>

	<p><i>"I loved him! I kissed him and when<br />
	our lips touched my name was seared<br />
	to the heart of every man alive</i></p>

	<p><i>"and every child whelped after. I sense<br />
	my style beats within your chest<br />
	&hellip; you cannot afford my dogma!"</i></p>
