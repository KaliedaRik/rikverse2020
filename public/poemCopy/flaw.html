<div aria-label="Poem body">
    <pre class="pre-sans">
Flaw sits in my cupboards
Flaw stands behind doors
Flaw hides in the curtains
          whittling its claws.
Flaw smirks in my mirrors
Flaw shadows my back
Flaw skips in my nightmares &ndash;
          it has that knack.

Flaw crumples my clothing
Flaw stains my best sheets
Flaw spits when I'm hungry
          and still I eat.
Flaw plagues my horizons
Flaw makes you all see
that Flaw is my partner &ndash;
          a true part of me.
