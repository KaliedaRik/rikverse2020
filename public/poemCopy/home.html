<p>When the wind was warm and the day<br />
longer than the reach between my arms,<br />
I sat on Dymchurch beach and built<br />
a child of sand: a head of turrets<br />
and broken shells, a necklace of seaweeds<br />
hung about its bucket neck.<br />
I gave it senses &mdash; pebbles for eyes,<br />
a hermit crab's home for a nose.</p>

<p>For hours I sat, telling the sand boy<br />
all I knew of my world, and listening,<br />
learning the littoral laws of a different world:<br />
tales of the kelp-flies and the wars of the lug.<br />
But the tide turned, wavelets racing<br />
over sandbars, each reaching further before<br />
the beach-hills sponged them dry.</p>

<p>I ran, my footfalls geysering seawater<br />
from razor shell wells beneath my toes.<br />
The breeze turned cool. Clouds shawled the sun.<br />
A larger wave caught me, pushed me<br />
behind the knees. I turned to see a pioneer crest<br />
crash to kiss the sand boy's belly.<br />
I hurled myself through ankle lagoons<br />
and dug mazes of moats ahead of my friend,<br />
trying to lose the tide in channels<br />
that curled like the kelp in a storm.</p>

<p>And it worked! With the sea mazed,<br />
the sand boy stood, a hermit claw<br />
waving hurrah at my deeds &mdash;<br />
until the first fat drops fell from the sky.<br />
I stood and watched the sand boy sink home<br />
as the rain beat increased, the necklace splitting<br />
as it swelled. Lightening fingered<br />
Martello towers, making me think<br />
of the sand boy sitting below the sea,<br />
shivering when the storm-winds blew.</p>

<p>When I left, I buried my vest and my shorts,<br />
so the sand boy would be dressed if the storm<br />
crashed it away to the walls of France.<br />
As the storm showered sand grit from my body,<br />
I clambered the curving concrete of the Dymchurch defenses,<br />
threw a stick at the wheeling seagulls,<br />
and charged home.</p>
