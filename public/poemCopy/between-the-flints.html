<div aria-label="Poem body">
	<p>An amber chain links<br />
	her loops around the roots <br />
	of mugwort, each pipe leg <br />
	frozen in its shape by ice.</p>

	<p>Endless knots of thread worms <br />
	dodge the clutch of frost<br />
	and sleep; they quilt a blanket <br />
	of clays beneath the sharp lawn.</p>

	<p>The saucer torus hidden within <br />
	an emerald sheen stagnates <br />
	like the last of its autumn cups: <br />
	no faries shall dance in this ring.</p>

	<p>A scrape tight in the hill; fur<br />
	wraps the flesh of the hare, his ears <br />
	radar alert as he rests mid-twitch <br />
	dreaming of madness, and stoat.</p>

	<p>The rarest of down flowers <br />
	hides its lures in layers<br />
	of fat, white leaves. Soon<br />
	a new sun will spire its delight.</p>
