<p>An amber chain links<br />
her loops around the roots <br />
of mugwort, each pipe leg <br />
frozen in its shape by ice.</p>

<p>Endless knots of thread worms <br />
dodge the clutch of frost<br />
and sleep; they quilt a blanket <br />
of clays beneath the sharp lawn.</p>

<p>The saucer torus hidden within <br />
an emerald sheen stagnates <br />
like the last of its autumn cups: <br />
no faries shall dance in this ring.</p>

<p>A scrape tight in the hill; fur<br />
wraps the flesh of the hare, his ears <br />
radar alert as he rests mid-twitch <br />
dreaming of madness, and stoat.</p>

<p>The rarest of down flowers <br />
hides its lures in layers<br />
of fat, white leaves. Soon<br />
a new sun will spire its delight.</p>
