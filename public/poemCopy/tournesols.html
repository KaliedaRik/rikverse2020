<p aria-label="Epigraph" class="epigraph">(After "Six Sunflowers, 1888" by van Gogh,<br />lost to bombing in 1945)</p>

<p>This presented image, dead as the hand that<br />
drew it, an echo blown to my time yet</p>

<p>flames erupt from each auburn wheel &ndash;<br />
they lick at the air, the desk: sinews</p>

<p>of heat shovelled on cloth. Leaves<br />
jag and drop to touch green glaze &ndash;</p>

<p>I want to tooth those dry seeds, sat<br />
by the window caught on the pot's neck</p>

<p>and swallow sunshine. So strong<br />
that lost paint of the hidden man.</p>
