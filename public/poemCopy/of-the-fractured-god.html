	<h3>1. Beyond love and thought, know this:</h3>

	<p><b>1.1</b> As the skies collapsed and the stars froze their flames to dust and the atoms in their spin drew together to perform the Dance of All Ends there came One who said: no.</p>

	<p><b>1.2</b> And the One created a fresh birth from cold death: a mote of considerations; an egg of possibilities; a lore to command a new Dance; a word and a hope. A home.</p>

	<p><b>1.3</b> And the Egg was all colours, and the colours beyond description. And the Egg was all melody and noise: the deepest rumble to grind bones; the sharpest peal to pierce sight. And the Egg was the heat of the furnace and the still of the space between touch. </p>

	<p><b>1.4</b> And the Egg was within the One, and around the One, and beyond the One. </p>

	<p><b>1.5</b> And when the last hug of the Dance of All Ends was held, and done, there remained only the Egg in a measureless, timeless void.</p>

	<p><b>1.6</b> The Egg was before time, before thought. The Egg was before breath, and light and dark. When the Dance of all Ends was no more, still the Egg spun.</p>

	<p><b>1.7</b> A moment between time and the Egg cracked and burst: a birth; a First Cataclysm. All became: a note of melody; a step of dance; a pain of hope.</p>

	<p><b>1.8</b> And the One was no more, and the One was each part everywhere. For no thing, no One can survive the Dance of All Ends. All that the One was, became star and space and wind and tears and love and hurt.</p>

	<p><b>1.9</b> From the patterns of the Dance rose Time, a first singe of a fresh note, another, and another. </p>

	<p><b>1.10</b> Alongside Time came Destiny, for the Dance is the lore and the lore is that all steps and spins must lead to a Dance of All Ends, which is the new Dance brought to completion.</p>

	<p><b>1.11</b> For the Dance is without Will, and Destiny is without Thought. And yet the One, who became each part everywhere as the First Cataclysm ruptured the Egg, was and remains and shall forever be - Will. The One who became each part everywhere was and remains and shall forever be - Thought.</p>

	<p><b>1.12</b> And from Thought comes Hope. And from Will comes Love. And the child of Hope and Love was, is, shall forever be: a breath, a spirit, an essence;</p>

	<p><b>1.13</b> The Lord is beyond Thought and Word! The Lord is everywhere, nameless and eternal in our eyes and our throats and our hearts! Know this, and dance!</p>

	<h3>2. Consider the mist and the clay; consider the goat and the dog:</h3>

	<p><b>2.1</b> Does the raindrop die when it falls to the dry sand?</p>

	<p><b>2.2</b> There is a grit, a grain of blown sand. There is a rock, sharp to eviscerate storms. The grit and the rock are the same in all ways.</p>

	<p><b>2.3</b> The river slices the desert; the river is the desert.</p>

	<p><b>2.4</b> We stood on the river's bank, beside swift water. We watched the sun bruise the clouds. You cried for the blood in the sky; I cried for the air in my throat. Have we not sinned?</p>

	<p><b>2.5</b> From mist appears a goat. It has bone horns; bone teeth. It carries a desert in its fleece. It carries the water of mist in its fleece. It chews cud to the pulse of stars.</p>

	<p><b>2.6</b> When we gathered our newborn child from the clays of our loins, and touched unbound love, did we not sin?</p>

	<p><b>2.7</b> I stand alone in mist; the mist slices my eyes, my ears, my throat, my fingers. There is no goat. There is no dog. There is no us.</p>

	<p><b>2.8</b> A dog stands on the river's bank. It claws at the clay. It watches the sun sink beyond the water, watches blood stain the sky. It has a throat and air in its lungs; it sits without howls.</p>

	<p><b>2.9</b> We saw the dog and the goat sat by the river. One chewed its cud; one let water drop from its tongue. Does the spittle drop die when it falls to dry sand?</p>

	<p><b>2.10</b> We take flint to flint; a spark shoots free from the strike. A new Egg, all colours, arcs in its joy. Do we not sin?</p>

	<p><b>2.11</b> The dog slices the mist; the dog is the mist.</p>

	<p><b>2.12</b> When we breached from the clays of our mothers' loins, did we not fracture our Lord with our first breath?</p>

	<p><b>2.13</b> Our Lord is beyond Thought and Word! Our Lord is everywhere, nameless and eternal in our eyes and our throats and our hearts! Know this, and dance!</p>

	<h3>3. We honour our ancestors; we honour each other; we honour ourselves:</h3>

	<p><b>3.1</b> The sun has shattered to embers on mists at the desert's edge. We walk along the bank of the river that defines the desert. A grit of worship touches at the step of each heel; a rock of memories emerges from the mist into moonlight. We are edges and outlines, white and black and all of the colour-sucked grains between. We are love beyond shadow; breath without voice; grief within hope.</p>

	<p><b>3.2</b> I walk with my sister. I step as she steps, I breathe as she breathes. My skin remembers the press of her knuckles when we fought. I honour the inevitable Dance.</p>

	<p><b>3.3</b> I honour my father and smile at the stories he brewed into my flesh. I tear the air with throat-caught cries for the echo of his words. Sharp is the leavened love I still hold for him in my bones.</p>

	<p><b>3.4</b> My sister walks like the ancestral wolf, each step a precision of muscles and sinews ready to break for the hunt. She wears her perfections like sin.</p>

	<p><b>3.5</b> Others walk among us, goats in the herd. Some step heavier; some sing. Such is the way of our fractured God. Does sin choose us?</p>

	<p><b>3.6</b> My brother wears his skin with no thought for the joy and the hurt. Grit and mist clay words across his skin but I cannot read their fractures.</p>

	<p><b>3.7</b> We walk together in worship, each in our own skin, each sheathing our thoughts in skulls beyond the touch of sun and grit and moon and mist and star song. A dog lifts its snout and howls; a goat bleats and runs. Are they not fractured? Are we not sin?</p>

	<p><b>3.8</b> My sister wears her skin with no thought for the hurt and the joy. Mist and grit clay words across her skin but I cannot read their fractures.</p>

	<p><b>3.9</b> Others walk among us, dogs in the pack. Some step lighter; some cry. Such is the way of our fractured God. Do we choose sin?</p>

	<p><b>3.10</b> My brother walks like the ancestral ibex, each step a precision of muscles and sinews ready to break for the hunt. He wears his perfections like sin.</p>

	<p><b>3.11</b> I honour my mother and smile at the stories she leavened into my flesh. I tear the air with throat-caught cries for the echo of her words. Harsh is the brewed love I still hold for her in my bones.</p>

	<p><b>3.12</b> I walk with my brother. I step as he steps, I breathe as he breathes. My skin remembers the press of his knuckles when we fought. I honour the inevitable Dance.</p>

	<p><b>3.13</b> The mists have shattered to rainbows on the sun's embrace and our Lord is beyond Thought and Word! Our Lord is everywhere, nameless and eternal in our eyes and our throats and our hearts! Know this, and dance!</p>
