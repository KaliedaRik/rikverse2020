<p class="epigraph">(After July 2005)</p>

<h3>Saturday 2</h3>

<p>Dancers on the stage built beside<br />
his plinth: his hair is a weave<br />
of pigeon wings. They watch<br />
the crowd below &ndash; billowy flags<br />
tied across burnt shoulders. Today<br />
our stage is glitter, our page<br />
a crease across the usual trade<br />
this place attracts. My hand<br />
wraps yours and when the band<br />
sings Abba, man to man, we kiss.</p>

<h3>Wednesday 6</h3>

<p>A singer on the stage beneath<br />
a screen that somersaults<br />
into the sky, its fringe a rump<br />
of pigeons. Announcements ruffle<br />
through the crowds of patriots &ndash;<br />
each one crossed in red, and white,<br />
and blue as dark as airless blood.<br />
Some ghosts in Asia tally votes<br />
and mouth a word: London! London!<br />
Bodies scream and dance and kiss.</p>

<h3>Thursday 7</h3>

<p>Children on the stage. They play<br />
oblivious to sirens screaming<br />
through the square. The crowds<br />
today are pigeons; rats with wings<br />
that peck at bread abandoned round<br />
his plinth. He sees the bowl of London<br />
from his perch, the whirls of smoke<br />
that mark the city's wounds, the litter<br />
of a busted bus to Hackney &ndash; trees<br />
decked in death before October's kiss.</p>
