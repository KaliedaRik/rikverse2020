<div aria-label="Poem body">
	<p>Look at you, sloven shortwings, your nests<br />
	a dereliction of twigs poked in sludge<br />
	beyond the gardened soils of the pond.</p>

	<p>Tourists gather to watch you fornicate,<br />
	those grub-chain toes scouring oil from plumes:<br />
	her head dives to avoid his bloodeye leer.</p>

	<p>Last year I watched you hatch four cuties,<br />
	bundles of floating chirrups, watched you peck<br />
	each to death in turn when you tired of them.</p>

	<p>Still you flirt your jaundiced legs, squabble<br />
	as you wave your saddle-white heads like liars<br />
	while scrumping breadcrumbs from goose-beaks.</p>
