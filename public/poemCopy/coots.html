<p>Look at you, sloven shortwings, your nests<br />
a dereliction of twigs poked in sludge<br />
beyond the gardened soils of the pond.</p>

<p>Tourists gather to watch you fornicate,<br />
those grub-chain toes scouring oil from plumes:<br />
her head dives to avoid his bloodeye leer.</p>

<p>Last year I watched you hatch four cuties,<br />
bundles of floating chirrups, watched you peck<br />
each to death in turn when you tired of them.</p>

<p>Still you flirt your jaundiced legs, squabble<br />
as you wave your saddle-white heads like liars<br />
while scrumping breadcrumbs from goose-beaks.</p>
