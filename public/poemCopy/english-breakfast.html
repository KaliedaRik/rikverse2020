<div aria-label="Poem body">
	<p>Where you spill milk across marble<br />
	black as galaxies strung on their web,<br />
	a unicorn. From steam spun droplets<br />
	ice clear on the spoon flash rainbows.<br />
	Assam scents sag as the net hefts clear<br />
	to turban cold air - memory elephants.<br />
	We sip peace from a mug in turns, naked.</p>
