	<p>You're fun! Not as funny as the time<br />
	we stood in the gay bar and watched<br />
	the fat drag act fire a replica cannon<br />
	which had, as his performance droned on,<br />
	slowly drooped until its dulled mouth<br />
	was level with the audience. <i>'That<br />
	will teach queens to douse in lacquer<br />
	on a Friday night,'</i> you said. I burned</p>

	<p>your hair, once, when we made a game<br />
	with candles and ropes. In those days<br />
	we would play twice a day: we'd pounce<br />
	each other for instant satisfaction.<br />
	Nowadays, gratitude comes in tea bags<br />
	and interrogations. I could have given<br />
	you up a decade ago, but somehow we found<br />
	a slow burn that keeps us chuckling still.</p>
