  <p>"Snow's melted; that's a good thing. We can't be having snow on the rocks, not this side of Christmas anyway."</p>

  <p>She plucks at some dead leaves marking the spot where the purple aubretia had burned &ndash; a  casualty of the November firework that had fallen, spent and smoking, into the garden. An alpine aster would make a good replacement for the casualty, she had decided at the time, but a shiny nub-hook of an early snowdrop bud had stopped her buying the new plant. She had assumed it was a message to let the plants be for a while; let them consider their options before making space for a new arrival.</p>

  <p>Not that she could have made it to the garden centre these past couple of months. She settles awkwardly to the work of checking, brushing and tidying the rockery, ignoring the bulk of her left arm in its cast and sling, its throbs accentuated by the sharp chill of damp air. </p>

  <p>For a moment she stops, compares the tones of the liver spots spread across the back of her thin, long hand with that of the earth packed between the stones and grits: they almost match, which brings a smile to her lips &ndash; another cryptic clue.</p>

  <p>She reaches for the diary laid by her knee and makes a quick scribble on today's page. "So much to do," she murmurs. "Too much, and no time left!"</p>

  <hr />

  <p>"She still seems pretty active, Mr Bland. Even with the broken wrist she's managing to get back on her feet. She's barely using her cane for support &ndash; a good demonstration of balance and coordination skills for a person of her age."</p>

  <p>David Bland doesn't look at the visitor, instead letting his gaze pass beyond the window above the kitchen sink. He watches the old woman carefully brush dirt and twigs from her pyjamas and tighten the belt of her thick, quilted house-gown.</p>

  <p>"It's not her physical state we're worried about, Dr Smallworthy. It's her mind that concerns us. She's always had her little eccentricities, but since the accident she's got a lot worse." </p>

  <p>Now he looks his guest in the eye. "Vacant, is how I'd describe it. Her body's here but her mind's gone wandering. Angela &ndash; that's my wife &ndash; these past couple of months have been very hard on her ..."</p>

  <p>"Mrs Feymount is your wife's mother?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," David agrees. The click of the kettle switching itself off as it reaches the frazzle of boiling point distracts him. "Do you take milk with your tea? Sugar?"</p>

  <p>"Thank you," says the doctor. "Yes to both, though not too much sugar. Sweetener would be better, if you have any." He pats his belly beneath its single-breasted waistcoat, though as far as David can make out the man carries scant fat around his waist.</p>

  <p>He prepares the drinks automatically, three cups aligned neatly across the pitted wooden work surface, each with their allotted tea bag. Angela's peppermint has been set on the left, furthest from the heap of sugar in its chipped Clarice Cliff bowl to remind him not to let the two mix together. Behind him, he hears the tall visitor ruffling through his slim, handle-less briefcase.</p>

  <p>Stir, catch; squeeze and dump. "So how long have you worked for Arcadia Vale?" Once the milk is added he turns to present the cup to the doctor, his professional smile, reserved for professional men, fixed across his face.</p>

  <p>"I've been working with the home for over five years, part-time."</p>

  <p>"You work for other homes as well?"</p>

  <p>"If that were the case, Mr Bland, I'd be a rich man! Arcadia Vale is an excellent, well managed operation; they pride themselves for maintaining a good working relationship with the local doctors and social services. My role is to advise the management on medical and welfare issues, and also to meet potential residents to assess their likely needs &ndash; should they choose to move into the home, of course."</p>

  <p>Whatever the doctor's protestations, David doubts that he lacks money. The signs of wealth are subtle: the lack of crease in the wool-spun jacket; the choice of cuff-links over buttons on the inch of white shirt sleeve half-covering the solidly-designed watch; the even stitching across the black leather of the pointed shoe. </p>

  <p>"You won't be my Mother-in-law's doctor then?"</p>

  <p>"Not unless she has to be admitted to hospital for any reason &ndash; my main place of work is at the geriatric unit there."</p>

  <p>Again the professional, interested smile. "So what is the purpose of this visit, then?"</p>

  <p>"As I said, we need to assess Mrs Feymount's needs: physical, emotional and spiritual &ndash; the whole package. And we need to see that she understands the facilities and options on offer to her. Though to be honest I rarely get to visit potential clients; normally we meet when they tour the home &ndash; something Mrs Feymount has not yet done, I believe. You have discussed this with her, yes?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," says David, adding an extra spoon of sugar to his own tea. "Charity &ndash; Mrs Feymount &ndash; has been talking about little else for the past month!"</p>

  <hr />

  <p>The photograph is framed with a simple wooden surround &ndash; the creamy lustre and relative straightness of the grain suggests white ash to Angela. She strokes the smoothed edges as she gazes at the image it holds: Chloe sits on her grandmother's knees, her feet barely touching the grass; the pale blue sky and the paucity of leaves on the trees beyond the rockery suggest early spring &ndash; yes, she can spot the collapsing browns of the sated daffodil blooms just breaking into the corner of the picture.</p>

  <p>"How can you two look so alike?" she whispers. Her Mother's hair is its usual mess of greying ringlets though a few still bear the russet gleam that haloes her daughter's face. Two faces, almost identical, each posed in a mirror's reflection of the other with only the aging of summers and the ghost of David's bones imposed on Chloe's cheeks to separate them.</p>

  <p>She misses the clatter of Chloe around the house; resents the distance between them, made physical these past few months when her baby travelled north to study in Leeds. "Why not Oxford, Chloe?" she had demanded to know. "They've offered you a place and a scholarship!" But her little girl had her own mind now, alongside a steely determination to do as she saw fit: Oxford was probably too close to home, too near to the nest for a fledgling testing her own wings.</p>

  <p>Her sigh is loud enough to interrupt her thoughts. Reluctantly, she lets the photo slip back to the night-stand, glances out of the bedroom window to check on her Mother's progress: the old woman is back on her feet now, brushing twigs and moss from her knees.</p>

  <p>They had argued again this morning, mother and daughter testing their respective determinations over toast. "You know Doctor Smallworthy's coming to see us today!"</p>

  <p>"Why did you agree to the man coming here at nine o'clock! You know I have things to do in the mornings."</p>

  <p>"He's a busy man, Mother. This is the only time he's got available before Christmas."</p>

  <p>"Then he can meet me in my pyjamas!" And that had been the end of the conversation.</p>

  <p>Another photograph catches her eye. Here stands her father with James; her brother's smile is wide and certain in his newfound adulthood &ndash; could it really be twenty years since he wrecked his car? She runs her fingers around the unlikely frame, a weave of willow twigs.</p>

  <p>Why willow? she wonders.</p>

  <p>Angela shivers. Sometimes her Mother's little mysteries anger her, but not today. She should be downstairs already with David and the Doctor. </p>

  <p>She takes a moment to check the state of her morning makeup in the oval mirror hung on the door before she leaves the room.</p>

  <hr />

  <p>"This is a wonderful house, Mrs Feymount. How long have you lived here?"</p>

  <p>"September 1940 &ndash; early September; school had just started when I arrived. I've been here ever since."</p>

  <p>"So you're not a local?" </p>

  <p>"I was born in London &ndash; somewhere in the East End &ndash; but the Germans took my parents and my home during the Blitz. This was my aunt's house, and my grandmother's before that."</p>

  <p>"So how do you feel about the idea of moving out?"</p>

  <p>Peter watches the woman in her dressing gown closely as she considered her answer. So much of his work involved watching people, searching the hands and the angles of the body for answers their minds and mouths were keen to conceal. This one is turning out to be surprisingly open, her posture and gestures in good synch with the words she utters.</p>

  <p>Which is more than can be said of the daughter and her husband. The man has stayed quiet, for the most part, since the women had joined them for this interview. His smiles are cold, disconnected from the signals semaphored by his eyes; his glance flicks over to his wife a little too often, like a dog waiting for commands. She, on the other hand, has chosen to present behind a mask of faint powders and eyeliner, the lipstick a blush of pink that almost certainly matches her natural colour. She sits erect, closed, her wrists neatly folded over her knee which, in turn, crosses its twin. When she chooses to look away from him, her eyes go to her mother's face, the lids and lines caught in a crossfire of frustration and concern.</p>

  <p>"I'll be sad to go," the old woman says after a short pause, the slight pull of a shrug across her shoulders confirming the truth of the statement. "There's been good times in this house, and not such good times too. But I have to say it's starting to be a bugger to keep the place clean. And Angie tells me this retirement home is only ten miles away; there's a direct bus route which means I can come and visit whenever I like."</p>

  <p>Perhaps she's being a little too sensible, he thinks as he continues the conversation. Questions form in his mouth by rote: recent health issues, problems with remembering things, how she gets on with her neighbours, how easy she finds it to make new friends. Charity dominates the conversation, even venturing to ask a few questions of her own. </p>

  <p>Angela's contributions are sharper; more often a clarification, the occasional interjection to back up Charity's assertions. But always that distance in her voice. She thinks she's betraying her Mother, forcing her to move, he concludes. She should be more worried about her husband's health. The faint taint of blue across his fingernails indicated some form of cyanosis &ndash; which with his seeming ease of breathing would suggest a possible circulatory catastrophe in the not too distant future.</p>

  <hr />

  <p>"Well, that was easier than I thought it would be," says Charity. She leans over to pat Angela's hands, feels the tightness in the sinews of her daughter's fingers still clasped across the knee. "How about we have a nice cup of tea before you go?"</p>

  <p>"I'll make it," says David. She nods her thanks to the man, peppering the gesture with a smile as he pushes against the desk at his side to haul himself upright. Soon enough she hears water barrelling from tap to kettle.</p>

  <p>"You're too quiet, Angie. Tell me what's wrong?"</p>

  <p>"There's nothing wrong, Mum. I'm ... well I'm a bit surprised that you were so positive about it all."</p>

  <p>"There's no point in throwing a fit in front of a stranger, dear. Still, I haven't changed my mind."</p>

  <p>She sees anger pinch her daughter's lips tight, a bare moment's loss of composure. "We've been through this, Mum, time and again."</p>

  <p>"You sound tired, dear." She lets her fingers tighten around her daughter's hands. "The solution is easy. Sell your house and move in here with me ..."</p>

  <p>"I can't just up-sticks ..."</p>

  <p>"Of course you can. Look at me, Angela! There's nothing to hold you in London now ..."</p>

  <p>"It's my home! It's Chloe's home! My job is in London &ndash; my career, David's work &ndash; everything! Your plan won't work, Mum."</p>

  <p>"And yet it must. This is as much your home as it is mine." Now the doors and windows are closed, the room is becoming hot; Charity lets her good hand loosen the folds of her house-gown. "This house is our history, for generations, and I want it to stay that way. And you know I won't be a burden &ndash; I'll be dead before next Christmas ..."</p>

  <p>"How can you say that! Don't say that! Don't talk about such things ..."</p>

  <p>"Nevertheless ..."</p>

  <p>"Who's told you you're going to die? Was it them?"</p>

  <p>She feels the vehemence of the accusation shake her daughter's frame as she utters it. Them! Angie had never forgiven them for what had happened to James. But then James had never believed, had never been able to see the truth of the rocks &ndash; like Aunt Mabel had told her long ago, such gifts were the wrong fit for the shape of a man's mind.</p>

  <p>Eyes locked to Angela's face, Charity nods. And smiles &ndash; a warm smile to stretch and exercise her wrinkles to their extremes.</p>

  <p>"You never used to be scared of them, my girl, and there's no need to fear them now &ndash; even though you know what they can do. But who else can I trust to guard the village against them?"</p>

  <p>She leans towards Angela, almost to touch noses, and whispers: "They might be pretty little buggers, fairies, but they're also nasty little buggers. It's in our blood, girl, the power to keep them trapped in those rocks. I've done my duty; now it's your turn, yes?"</p>

  <p>She watches her daughter sob then, after a while, nod.</p>
