<p aria-label="Epigraph" class="epigraph">(After Federico Garc√≠a Lorca's <a href="https://es.wikisource.org/wiki/Llagas_de_amor">Llagas de amor</a>)</p>

<div aria-label="Poem body" data-form="Unrhymed sonnet">
	<p>This searchlight beam, this fire that sears and eats.<br />
	This gray haze landscape pressing on my skin.<br />
	This stretch of pain to seek that one idea.<br />
	This moment's heartbreak: sky and world and time.</p>

	<p>This pulse of blood, its spots to decorate<br />
	a still and strumless lyre, a slick of flame.<br />
	This heft of ocean's wave to hold me down.<br />
	This scorpion hid in my ribs: and claws, and sting.</p>

	<p>They are a garland love, a bed for wounds<br />
	in which I lie dreamless, I dream you here<br />
	against my flesh, this chest: heavy and ruined.</p>

	<p>And though I seek the peaks of reasoned faith,<br />
	your heart presents to me a valley strewn<br />
	with hemlock feathers: such a bitter science.</p>
