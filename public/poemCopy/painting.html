	<p>Walls are not blank. They soak in lives, each pore<br />
	in the mortar a pit to house outbursts and tears.</p>

	<p>We chose the scheme together: a brush of faint cream;<br />
	a slice of simnel; a feather of fresh-hatched chick.</p>

	<p>And so we paint: this emulsion stroke shall cover<br />
	the time we argued the length of a bottle of whisky.</p>

	<p>I texture the colour with cobwebs, old nets to catch<br />
	forgotten meals, parties; the husks of anniversaries.</p>

	<p>As the room grows in its new coat I follow your lines:<br />
	dab wet gloss on the skirting, wipe spats from my hair.</p>

	<p>When it is done, we make a good memory &ndash; a kiss &ndash;<br />
	for the walls to record. A cat-hair glides in the fume.</p>
