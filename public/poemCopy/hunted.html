<p>She hides in curtains. There's a whiff<br />
of monsters in the morning air and care<br />
is required. She has charms to bear<br />
her soul in its cage of links but what if<br />
they fail today? Dare she risk a chance<br />
encounter with Hell in people's eyes<br />
unprotected? She knows there are spies<br />
in lamp-lights and switches, they glance<br />
at her in sweeps and radiations<br />
that never stop, endless chatter<br />
in unbreakable codes and still she hides<br />
in curtains, their cloth a libation<br />
to the spirits of silence, to a smatter<br />
of quiet she once held in her mind.</p>
