	<p>As he settles in his pot his bones<br />
	migrate to the top, sorted by shakes<br />
	and caresses, the currents of time.</p>

	<p>She hid him in the toilet, let spiders<br />
	weave him to the wall. His handles become<br />
	birth-chambers, banqueting halls, crypts.</p>

	<p>She rubs tears on her chest to ease the pain.</p>
