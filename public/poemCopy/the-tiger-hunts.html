<p>She walks the sods and the soils of the Marsh, <br />
each saucer paw puddling the dirt<br />
into oval dents. When ditches block<br />
her path she leaps them, pitching her limbs<br />
in a stretch across the stagnant waters &mdash;<br />
a surge of blacks and sorrels burst<br />
through the chilled air, chasing the ducks<br />
from sleep in the reeds. She sniffs at the earth, <br />
whiskers spreading the stiffened shafts<br />
of winter wheat in whorls and swirls, <br />
touching, tasting the tangs of this world.</p>

<p>She stills mid-step when she sees the prey: <br />
a lamb-swelled sheep lifts up its head,<br />
cud on the tongue, twitch-ears sculling<br />
for a hint of sound outside the known<br />
creaks and crackles of its cold-hugged home.</p>

<p>Slowly, she shifts &mdash; a splint of an inch:<br />
a slide of muscle, a slip of claw<br />
through dock and clover, and crouch, and settle <br />
the tail, and wait. Watch for the tuck<br />
of a head, the scrape of hoof on ice &hellip;</p>

<p>&hellip; and dash! Her furs flash as she streaks <br />
across the turf; a tap of her pad<br />
and they tumble down, a tousle of wool <br />
and hoof and scat. The herd stampedes, <br />
their bleat alarms alerting others: <br />
<i>danger! Danger! Dogs on the loose! <br />
Teeth on the throat! Tearing, ripping. <br />
Run to the gate; gather and huddle!</i></p>

<p>But she is no hound. She hauls her catch <br />
back to the ditch, dips through the reeds <br />
and into the water, etching a curl<br />
of ripples from bank to bank as she paddles <br />
her course to the sluice, and the sea beyond.</p>
