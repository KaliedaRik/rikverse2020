<div aria-label="Poem body" data-form="Alliterative Verse">
	<p>She walks the sods and the soils of the Marsh, <br />
	each saucer paw puddling the dirt<br />
	into oval dents. When ditches block<br />
	her path she leaps them, pitching her limbs<br />
	in a stretch across the stagnant waters &ndash;<br />
	a surge of blacks and sorrels burst<br />
	through the chilled air, chasing the ducks<br />
	from sleep in the reeds. She sniffs at the earth, <br />
	whiskers spreading the stiffened shafts<br />
	of winter wheat in whorls and swirls, <br />
	touching, tasting the tangs of this world.</p>

	<p>She stills mid-step when she sees the prey: <br />
	a lamb-swelled sheep lifts up its head,<br />
	cud on the tongue, twitch-ears sculling<br />
	for a hint of sound outside the known<br />
	creaks and crackles of its cold-hugged home.</p>

	<p>Slowly, she shifts &ndash; a splint of an inch:<br />
	a slide of muscle, a slip of claw<br />
	through dock and clover, and crouch, and settle <br />
	the tail, and wait. Watch for the tuck<br />
	of a head, the scrape of hoof on ice &hellip;</p>

	<p>&hellip; and dash! Her furs flash as she streaks <br />
	across the turf; a tap of her pad<br />
	and they tumble down, a tousle of wool <br />
	and hoof and scat. The herd stampedes, <br />
	their bleat alarms alerting others: <br />
	<i>danger! Danger! Dogs on the loose! <br />
	Teeth on the throat! Tearing, ripping. <br />
	Run to the gate; gather and huddle!</i></p>

	<p>But she is no hound. She hauls her catch <br />
	back to the ditch, dips through the reeds <br />
	and into the water, etching a curl<br />
	of ripples from bank to bank as she paddles <br />
	her course to the sluice, and the sea beyond.</p>
