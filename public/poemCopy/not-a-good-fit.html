<p>Our cozy office echoes more today.<br />
Where once a colleague sat, a colder light;<br />
a clear expanse of of boxy white, contrite<br />
desk: how could he fail? The deft display<br />
of his dismissal scares me: bait and switch<br />
and &ndash; gone. Just yesterday we spoke of hopes<br />
and holidays, some action points &ndash; those ropes<br />
that keep us dancing at our stations &hellip; which</p>

<p>of us is next? I look around at friends,<br />
acquaintances, their jaws slack and their skins<br />
a touch more blanched. For each of us has sins,<br />
I guess; each one of us must guard our plans<br />
and hope the folks who file the axe forgive<br />
our daily, thoughtless faults: I can't give in!</p>
