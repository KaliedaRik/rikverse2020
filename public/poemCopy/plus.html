<p>Today I tested positive<br />
for the blood plague. I watched<br />
for corpuscle explosions<br />
as the tech pulled more red pints<br />
for the counting of things &ndash;<br />
I saw no tell-tale fizz in the tubes.</p>

<p>Do the motes whistle<br />
as they busy themselves constructing<br />
new motes? They're happy<br />
to thieve the labours of my cells,<br />
rip apart the curtains<br />
of phospho-lipids and take the stage.</p>

<p>Beyond the clinic walls<br />
a cleaner sweeps cherry petals<br />
from asphalt &ndash; she sweats<br />
in a slip of sunshine between clouds.<br />
I am as numb as flowers:<br />
I still have much sunshine to catch.</p>
