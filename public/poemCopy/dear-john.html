	<p>You laugh like a gutter &ndash; a whoop<br />
	of hollow gulps slung from lungs<br />
	to pulp even the spider cowed<br />
	in her mat-thick webs in the cornice.</p>

	<p>Every bottle you meet is a challenge<br />
	to be accepted and defeated;<br />
	your claim to care only for vintage<br />
	belches through the torrents consumed.</p>

	<p>The way you stroke me after sex &ndash;<br />
	a toddler pets its kitten more sweetly &hellip;<br />
	Open your eyes wide, and wide again:<br />
	our time together will end with a grave!</p>
