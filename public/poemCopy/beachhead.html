<p>Here lie brittlestars, evicted from deep-channel muds <br />
by a winter storm &mdash; now gone &mdash; onto the Dymchurch littoral <br />
in drifts of outcast mating waves. Morning breezes <br />
grit-skit across the tide-abandoned sands, <br />
dessicating bootlace legs searching, curling in prayer. <br />
Seagull clouds scream, spear-hunting the sex-spent discs.</p>

<p class='ml-6 italic'>Such star strewn scenes are a memory for me here. <br />
This city's streets are blotched by populations scurrying <br />
from path to path: coloured currents of flow and tide <br />
streaming through my sight. Paddling by the kerb <br />
I wait for an ebb, dive deep within the scene. <br />
As the torrents take me, I ply the storms that brew <br />
in the city heat, ride the rapture foams that smack me <br />
further from home.</p>

<p>Walking tall, I make belief: a god in a sometimes land. <br />
The sea's detritus stacks the tide mark, cities <br />
of weed and cans woven with life. Between the piles <br />
sandstorms rage, blasting the walls of flotsam halls. <br />
With brown hoods and razor beaks, gulls patrol the expanse, <br />
interrogate strands for easy prey. Pluck lice <br />
from the wracks, crabs from their shells. <br />
Wait to see me fall.</p>

<p class='ml-6 italic'>Summer. I walk with my lover the length of Mare Street. <br />
Heat powers a breeze that picks dirt from the streets <br />
to make dust devils dance their crazed vortex formations <br />
between the bustling, bricked parades of Hackney Town. <br />
Fire catches the rubbish heaps, heaving black belches <br />
into the skies through which lost gulls sail, white in the mire.</p>

<p>As we pass through crowds I catch his hand in mine, <br />
blow him a kiss. Above us gulls circle: shriek insults <br />
and tongue gossip. I smile as he puckers his response. <br />
Our beachhead is built on small gestures and dreams: <br />
today I watch the gulls starve.</p>
