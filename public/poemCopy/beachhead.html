	<p>Here lie brittlestars, evicted from deep-channel muds <br />
	by a winter storm &ndash; now gone &ndash; onto the Dymchurch littoral <br />
	in drifts of outcast mating waves. Morning breezes <br />
	grit-skit across the tide-abandoned sands, <br />
	dessicating bootlace legs searching, curling in prayer. <br />
	Seagull clouds scream, spear-hunting the sex-spent discs.</p>

	<p class='strophe-indented-with-italics'>Such star strewn scenes are a memory for me here. <br />
	This city's streets are blotched by populations scurrying <br />
	from path to path: coloured currents of flow and tide <br />
	streaming through my sight. Paddling by the kerb <br />
	I wait for an ebb, dive deep within the scene. <br />
	As the torrents take me, I ply the storms that brew <br />
	in the city heat, ride the rapture foams that smack me <br />
	further from home.</p>

	<p>Walking tall, I make belief: a god in a sometimes land. <br />
	The sea's detritus stacks the tide mark, cities <br />
	of weed and cans woven with life. Between the piles <br />
	sandstorms rage, blasting the walls of flotsam halls. <br />
	With brown hoods and razor beaks, gulls patrol the expanse, <br />
	interrogate strands for easy prey. Pluck lice <br />
	from the wracks, crabs from their shells. <br />
	Wait to see me fall.</p>

	<p class='strophe-indented-with-italics'>Summer. I walk with my lover the length of Mare Street. <br />
	Heat powers a breeze that picks dirt from the streets <br />
	to make dust devils dance their crazed vortex formations <br />
	between the bustling, bricked parades of Hackney Town. <br />
	Fire catches the rubbish heaps, heaving black belches <br />
	into the skies through which lost gulls sail, white in the mire.</p>

	<p class='strophe-indented-with-italics'>As we pass through crowds I catch his hand in mine, <br />
	blow him a kiss. Above us gulls circle: shriek insults <br />
	and tongue gossip. I smile as he puckers his response. <br />
	Our beachhead is built on small gestures and dreams: <br />
	today I watch the gulls starve.</p>
