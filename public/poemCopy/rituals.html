	<p>Autumn would bring us rituals to school.<br />
	Conkers: bootlace strung,<br />
	hung from coat toggles on proud display.<br />
	Until smashed.</p>

	<p>All Hallow's eve and tall-cone witch hats:<br />
	card masks green finger painted &ndash; soon torn,<br />
	berry potions, and dare-stolen grave chippings<br />
	slipped quietly to the pockets of rivals and foes<br />
	as a curse.</p>

	<p>Fireworks for the fifth:<br />
	celebrate the demise of our grand manikin<br />
	paraded on shoulders around the school ground,<br />
	lighting the close night with its broken-wood pyre<br />
	and sprouting buttered jacket potatoes<br />
	from the embers.</p>

	<p>Poppies:<br />
	Card-petalled, stem-chewed, Haig-stamped,<br />
	that led us coldly as mist to morning<br />
	to the sword-carved cross ahead of the church<br />
	where once the lintel gallows stood<br />
	and we were paraded, dreaming<br />
	of warming cold rain from woolen uniforms</p>

	<p>&ndash; it was beyond me: only a poppy,<br />
	and I knew dead soldiers breathe again<br />
	when playtime has gone.</p>
