<p>Put down the messenger, the dog who barked<br />
a phosphate storm: tearing this foot from this leg,<br />
slipping a shoe from a strawberry sock;<br />
dusting that kid in a film of concrete<br />
and glass, still eyes open, snapped in the act<br />
of gathering. Leash the mutt and cull it,<br />
the tightly trained weapon who listened<br />
to a master's voice &mdash; sniffed out and tracked down, <br />
took out the hate-full enemy. Then sat, loyal dog,<br />
through the courtroom storm. His pleasure mute<br />
at his attested translation into the Lassie<br />
who never came home.</p>
