		<p class="level-with-top">You made me in the end. You found<br />
		a key, tuned it to my lock and then,<br />
		without knowing why, I opened for you. <br />
		Chatting music and snapping exotica <br />
		we learnt to talk together. There,<br />
		in the zoo on the hill, perched over the Marsh,<br />
		we fed peacocks and flashed cassowaries. <br />
		Together we discovered the restored house,<br />
		its history and gardens. We rebuilt our past<br />
		during that summer as we touched the tame <br />
		elephants, when I stopped hiding from <br />
		your eyes, accepted your story in me.</p>
