<div aria-label="Poem body">
	<p>A surl of girls at bicker, their satchels<br />
	hung low. Each lecturing voice lessens<br />
	the pleasure of the ride, rude platitudes<br />
	shilling for audience: <i>she was the one<br />
	wot said it first</i> and <i>she's free with her kisses<br />
	when it suits her needs.</i> Their stop can't come<br />
	quick enough: the sigh that slices the aisle<br />
	when they debark is plush &ndash; a prayer that spreads <br />
	the length of the bus. Their exit leaves seats<br />
	for the claim; passengers tango speechlessly,<br />
	compete for a prize &ndash; a space to plonk<br />
	our still-waking flesh as the wheels <br />
	of the Machine tumble us to work.</p>
