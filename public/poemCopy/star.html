	<p>Blackmanstone: your first home, a tumbled house <br />
	at the crossroads where the tracks march flat <br />
	by miles, sketching their courses around ditches <br />
	and boundaries long forgotten, like the churchland <br />
	mansions that once gloried beneath this rounded sky. </p>

	<p>Orgarswick, where I was conceived, carried, <br />
	birthed into a land grand in its narrow time. A street <br />
	named for a farm that was once a village, living <br />
	by the tides and mists and the endless breeze. Bricks <br />
	in fields break ploughshares, prove the land has changed. </p>

	<p>Churches pucker the Marsh into spires, their arches <br />
	wide to span the leagues of life and death <br />
	that litter our once and sometime world. Weeds <br />
	grow high within the boneyards. Colour spotting <br />
	between the factory fields of sulphur rape. </p>

	<p>In the ruins of Blackmanstone, I can stand <br />
	at the centre of the galaxy, watch the earth <br />
	change. I asked you once, here: why do villages <br />
	die? You smiled, said nothing. Let the Marsh <br />
	echo her misty gusts through my head.</p>
