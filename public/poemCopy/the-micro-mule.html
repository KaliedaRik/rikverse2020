<p>"There must be laws against this sort<br />
of thing! I mean &ndash; there's me, you know,<br />
right there in the Spot, the sugarmill<br />
just ticking over nicely when<br />
some bastard 'god' just pops along<br />
and sticks a stack of beads across<br />
my back, you know? Like I'm a giant<br />
of multicellularity!<br />
Yeah, right! And then the bastards steal<br />
my heat and light, evict me like<br />
some virus scum. And now they play<br />
their games &ndash; a sweet light here, a smell<br />
of toxins there and I'm away:<br />
go up this channel, round that bend &ndash;<br />
it's like a bloody maze in here!<br />
My poor flagellae beat like strips<br />
of, well, flagellae I suppose<br />
and if I had a set of nerves<br />
I bet they'd scream in pain by now!<br />
I mean, I ask you, mate, for what?<br />
Nirvana ain't supposed to be <br />
like this!"</p>
