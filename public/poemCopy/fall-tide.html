<div aria-label="Poem body">
	<p>A winter-withered wordman's remains<br />
	buried in Rome; he wrote of you,<br />
	your mellow tones and mossy trees.</p>

	<p>No poppies massed in Peterloo,<br />
	just cutlass blood; he caught that mood<br />
	in ink and ache to augur your demise.</p>

	<p>Ten-score orbits on and you return<br />
	to nothing changed; a charge of councels<br />
	supremely sat to stymie rights</p>

	<p>&ndash; or not. Who knows what novel buds<br />
	will bear in spring's next song? A buzz<br />
	of un-homed wasp huzzes my window.</p>
