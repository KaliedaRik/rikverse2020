<p>A winter-withered wordman's remains<br />
buried in Rome; he wrote of you,<br />
your mellow tones and mossy trees.</p>

<p>No poppies massed in Peterloo,<br />
just cutlass blood; he caught that mood<br />
in ink and ache to augur your demise.</p>

<p>Ten-score orbits on and you return<br />
to nothing changed; a charge of councels<br />
supremely sat to stymie rights</p>

<p>- or not. Who knows what novel buds<br />
will bear in spring's next song? A buzz<br />
of un-homed wasp huzzes my window.</p>
