	<p>My God has skin that tints alongside time: <br />
	it darkens from daybreak pink through midmorning <br />
	mediterranean olive to ebony noon, then coasts <br />
	through afternoon teak to dusk and twilight <br />
	and moonlight white. </p>

	<p>God's hair plats and scrambles across the brow <br />
	and builds a rainbow halo of yellow, orange, <br />
	brown and black. The mane frames God's face: tears <br />
	cascade down cheeks and drip from the chin <br />
	to water the world. </p>

	<p>To paint my God, I site my belief <br />
	on a rock in the river. In dance God's fingers hoist <br />
	the sky to the void: toes tap my earth's root. <br />
	The wind lifts the forest's leaves in chorus <br />
	and my brush sings. </p>

	<p>But details beguile me. I cannot paint God's face. <br />
	When I come to the mouth, I see rips across the lips,  <br />
	scabs sealing the maw shut. I ache to see my God's eyes <br />
	but lids are sewn tight: the sockets hollow.  <br />
	Waxmelt earlobes drum the jaw </p>

	<p>in time with my tapdance lungheaves: a gale gust <br />
	strips the leaves, the forest bank. My horizon tightens. <br />
	Tips me across my rock. My God grows taut, the strain shakes bones <br />
	separating my salvation from my sin. Time finds a voice in me: <br />
	<i>they say you don't exist </i> </p>

	<p>and God shatters. My pillar. My support. My black from white. <br />
	My right from wrong. Gone. The forests along the bank sink, shrink <br />
	from sight in my river run wild. A newborn sea swamping my life.Yet the sky <br />
	fails to fall, and my rock remains. I scream. Sob. Grow still. See: <br />
	my ocean has waves that tint alongside time.</p>
