<div aria-label="Poem body">
	<p>To the cat on his back who sulks<br />
	for the lack of some verse he can tack<br />
	to his name: shall I jig as you nip<br />
	at my toes? Believe me, dear puss,<br />
	that the lengths I would go to achieve<br />
	an award of your purr are beyond<br />
	the measure of claws; do I dare<br />
	an attack on your belly-flared fur?<br />
	The unblinking attention of bronzed<br />
	glare suggests &ndash; no. Perhaps it is best<br />
	if I give you some lines and retreat:<br />
	in the land of this lion, I'm lunch.</p>
