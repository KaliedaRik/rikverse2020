<div aria-label="Poem body">
	<p>Health &ndash; an exercise<br />
	in barrenness; a factory,<br />
	a fair of pain hid beneath<br />
	Victoria's ice-sweat streets.</p>

	<p class='strophe-indented'>We stretch and lift<br />
	in rows, video-plugged.</p>

	<p>Music, heartbeats &ndash;<br />
	count the numbers, chart<br />
	some lines; programmes pre-set,<br />
	static conveyors to fitness.</p>

	<p class='strophe-indented'>Compete! A second less,<br />
	a kilo more, beat them!</p>

	<p>Bulbs searchlight the park,<br />
	their beams stretch limbs &ndash; alien,<br />
	tangled branches, paths. I gasp,<br />
	hard breaths; heels lift and reach.</p>

	<p class='strophe-indented'>This is our game: to chase,<br />
	to lap; to catch fat geese.</p>

	<p>I am a new merchant.<br />
	I trade endorphins, blood<br />
	to brain, an addict; a lover:<br />
	glory comes to those who strive!</p>
