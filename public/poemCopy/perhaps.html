<p>The desk sits square on the side of the room.<br />
Touch polished panels meld with the dusk.<br />
Hard drawers grin half-shut<br />
and gabbled papers stray, confused<br />
between cups and pens edging<br />
to cascade on the floor.<br />
Midway, brass handles spit brass reflections<br />
across the bed &ndash; unmade &ndash;<br />
towards the door, unlocked.</p>

<p>Behind the desk stands the oval mirror,<br />
baroque curves and tainted glass.<br />
In the mirror of the desk, papers are stacked.<br />
Pens line the rim of the cup<br />
in stout regiments, headless stalks.<br />
In the mirror of the room, curtains are hung,<br />
the floor is swept, carpet tufts are spright.<br />
The bed is made, the door is locked<br />
and I am not here.</p>
