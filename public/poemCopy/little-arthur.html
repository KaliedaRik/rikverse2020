<p>Hail the spore as it kisses the ant!<br />
Watch as it sprouts and mounts its steed:</p>

<p>white threads needle over the barding;<br />
sharp tips lance the pauldron gaps.</p>

<p>Now in, it spins and knits a new flesh<br />
between the silks of muscle and fat.</p>

<p>A circlet of barbs surround, siege the bascinet<br />
ganglia, and breach: fresh rules for the beast.</p>

<p>Come a new dawn, a penitent ant clambers<br />
high over scaffolds to view England's heart;</p>

<p>it lifts its belly to salute the dressed crowds<br />
as they scurry from train to stall to concrete cell.</p>

<p>When the Grail erupts from its annealed armour<br />
a billion spores puff over us: Camelot blooms!</p>
