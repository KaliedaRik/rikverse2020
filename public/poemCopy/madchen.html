<p class="epigraph">(After the Venus of Hohle Fels)</p>

<p>She is, above all, a drama of curves<br />
carved from the tooth. A finger's trophy,</p>

<p>she maps the wills of our sires and dams<br />
in fragments, a mistress of ecologies</p>

<p>whose beasts rut-roar in powder silences &ndash;<br />
shall daylight humble her? Shall the measure</p>

<p>of each of her arcs and scars strip apart<br />
the last of our homeless, hidden humanity?</p>

<p>Her caverns guest only the voyeur's breath:<br />
the stars in her heavens spin apart.</p>
