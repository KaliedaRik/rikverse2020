<div aria-label="Poem body">
	<p>We first furled as brown trees blushed pink<br />
	in frosts: him taller, I more muscled,<br />
	we made a knit of tongues, a fret of limbs<br />
	as we drank ourselves to convulsions.</p>

	<p>We were done before the petals fell.<br />
	As cherries swelled I listened again<br />
	and over to the mix-tape he gave me:<br />
	<i>'All that's left is a band of gold &hellip;'</i></p>

	<p>I can't play his music today. As seasons<br />
	blew the tech grew and consumed us all;<br />
	soon that keen flash of his iceberg eyes<br />
	will melt from my wits, like a wish.</p>
