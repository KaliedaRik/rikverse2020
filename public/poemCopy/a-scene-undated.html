<p>A gargoyle sits in its arch and watches. A mill of peasants processes in funnels and wheels around the market; a touch here to test ripeness, a comment shared over cloth. A boy in broken sandals, hair shorn like the sheep. A grind of gravel as a cart clops a path through crowds. In the porch below, almost beyond sight-line, two women nurse infants: one has rags for a shoulder shawl; the other covers heads in silk, as a memory to God. An attar of peach rot clears space near a grave. A man in britches smiles at the pleasure of new teeth. A cloud the colour of pigeons rules its shadow over awnings. The cog with a missing spoke clacks as it turns; when the turns are sufficient a bell will ding and the gargoyle sleep, rock still, as a day hazes to its ebb.</p>
