<p class='epigraph'>"Greetings. It is possible that some word of me <br />
may have come to you, though even this <br />
is doubtful &hellip;" (Petrarch)</p>

<h3>I. For Poets Eighty Years Hence</h3>

<p>I am not your friend.<br />
I have no ears to hear you.</p>

<p>My teeth &ndash; mere rattles.<br />
My dirk tongue &ndash; dissolved in dusts.</p>

<p>Your breath is not mine.<br />
Your dreams leave me unshaken.</p>

<p>In myriad ways<br />
we are separate species.</p>

<h3>II. The Lazarus Sign</h3>

<p>When my neighbour dies she crosses<br />
her arms to her breast; her trembly fingers<br />
butterfly around the sags of her neck &ndash;</p>

<p><i>'a reflex, no more,'</i> says the nurse<br />
who cradles a slosh of warm plastic<br />
bed pan. <i>'You should not be here</i></p>

<p><i>to see it.'</i> I nod my thanks, watch as<br />
her hands fall still, settle in the curl<br />
of her collapsed chest, and cool.</p>

<h3>III. The Bones of Levissi</h3>

<p>After the bus departs, silence. Ahead<br />
the town invites us to walk its streets, a wreck<br />
of tumbled roofs and weed-blown mortars stacked<br />
within its bowl of suntan hills. Instead<br />
we sit and read the guide, a summary<br />
of dates and states and settlements that ripped<br />
the artisans from hearths and tools and shipped<br />
them overseas to Rhodes. We scope the debris</p>

<p>and climb a path to view the churches; here<br />
we whisper comments, offer hands to push<br />
ourselves through glass-less window gaps and bash<br />
the thorny brush apart, two pioneers<br />
discovering &ndash; a well. I look within:<br />
an oubliette of strangers guised in grins.</p>

<h3>IV. We Make Room in the Ground for Incomers</h3>

<p>In Crete they pay a priest to bleach the bones before<br />
the village gathers round to check the dead for worth;<br />
the struts of good and pious folk are free of stain.<br />
My bones are cracked to charcoal. I am not your friend.</p>
