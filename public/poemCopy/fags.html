<p>I smiled at the news that They, the Ones who Know<br />
better than we-who-all-die could ever decide the capacity<br />
of damage we can bear, have concluded that colours<br />
can kill. I am no longer trusted to select my death<br />
based on the shine of its cardboard wrap. Instead<br />
I must harry rushed shop counter staff, ask them to quest<br />
for my choice: <i>"this pack, mister? You sure this time?"</i><br />
Who knows? The letters that brand the carton's cancers<br />
get dwarfed by meticulous designs of coffins: a kid<br />
choked on the smoke her mama blows; a fat-dripping vein;<br />
an autopsy slab that perfectly glints its chromes &ndash;<br />
yet amid the flux of Big Letter notes, the largest is stark:</p>

<p class="strophe-indented"><b>Duty Paid.</b></p>

<p>And to cream the corpses, the colour that They, the muppety ones,<br />
workshopped for months to damp my desire to buy a nicotine fix<br />
<span class="lines-indented">&ndash; opaque couch&eacute;: a pretty name to my ear &ndash;</span><br />
now stomps and splashes in the streets of Hipster Shoreditch<br />
in trainers and shop signs &hellip; <i>and so it goes</i>.</p>
