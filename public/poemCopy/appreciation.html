<div aria-label="Poem body">
	<p>In the kingdom of time suspended<br />
	I see the dancer arched:<br />
	a foot is grounded, a thigh<br />
	is tense-taut. The second swings free.<br />
	A shaved chest congeals into arms,<br />
	into fingers circling a bar<br />
	above a stubbled, arrogant head.<br />
	A grey-toned face shades from highlights<br />
	to perspiration to spot reflection<br />
	in grain-hazed eyes.</p>

	<p>In the kingdom of time assumed<br />
	I could cruise, perhaps meet<br />
	this icon, fleshed in colour and cloth.<br />
	He would walk with the ease of a cat,<br />
	animate friends with words, or maybe<br />
	act the Jimmy Dean &ndash; cool to desire.<br />
	His jeans would pucker across his legs<br />
	and his jacket sway easy on the hooks<br />
	of sweat-erected shoulders.<br />
	He would have a name from me &ndash;<br />
	<i>sweet fuckable,</i> but I am trapped</p>

	<p>in a third, united kingdom, where time<br />
	is commodity, and by law my desire<br />
	must be tethered, controlled.<br />
	Appreciation is tempered:<br />
	an appropriate statement, a critical word &ndash;<br />
	shadow and light. Form and space.<br />
	An artisan perusing another's art<br />
	before moving on.</p>
