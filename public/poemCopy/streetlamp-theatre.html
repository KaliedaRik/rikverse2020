<div aria-label="Poem body">
	<p>Maggie stands tall tonight.<br />
	She has nails for heels<br />
	and cloth around her hips<br />
	damp from the low cloud.</p>

	<p>Cars slow, stop, inquire &ndash;<br />
	she ignores their chrome charm.<br />
	Maggie stands tall tonight.</p>

	<p>Lads drunk on new tattoos<br />
	offer tatter-notes for favours.<br />
	She has nails for heels</p>

	<p>and sees no reason to upgrade &ndash;<br />
	she shuts away the pretty faces,<br />
	keeps cloth around her hips.</p>

	<p>And when the face she needs<br />
	arrives, wallet on chain<br />
	damp from the low cloud</p>

	<p>she takes chrome from her purse<br />
	and fucks his chest with bullets.<br />
	Maggie stands tall tonight.</p>
