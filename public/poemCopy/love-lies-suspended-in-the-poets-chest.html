<p aria-label="Epigraph" class="epigraph">(After Federico Garc√≠a Lorca's <a href="https://es.wikisource.org/wiki/El_amor_duerme_en_el_pecho_del_poeta">El amor duerme en el pecho del poeta</a>)</p>

<p>Never will you know how hard I love you;<br />
you sleep in me, a rest of chrysalis.<br />
I'm crying here, now; I hide you, hunted<br />
by a voice that penetrates even steel.</p>

<p>The lore that stirs both flesh and star alike,<br />
it punctures, seeps into my chest in aches &ndash;<br />
a stew of mulm words have bitten and chewed<br />
the hard angle wings of your stringent soul.</p>

<p>People cluster in lush gardens: they jump;<br />
they wait to see your shape, my agony;<br />
they ride horses with manes of light and green.</p>

<p>So you must maintain your slumber, my life.<br />
Hear my blood as it breaks in violins!<br />
Can you see them? Still they are stalking us!</p>
