<div aria-label="Poem body">
	<p>Indulge me, please: I don't see emotions when I write<br />
	'blue'. A damp touch of waves across instep, a taste of spray<br />
	from kicked water &ndash; insults from the drenched should ring<br />
	more? Where's that shoulder shudder when a pulsing plastic bag<br />
	wraps its current-tweased-and-twisted tentacle strips across<br />
	my knee? I want to please, but where's the sunny heat, huh?</p>

	<p>Is your 'blue' my 'blue'? Is theirs? A poem should be a roil:<br />
	emotion pulled from image by platformed alchemists and yet I am<br />
	not that man. I cannot transact insights. I cannot &ndash; emote &ndash; a 'blue'<br />
	for you and yet this blue wall &ndash; we (not you) painted it<br />
	together, drunk on homebrew wine &ndash; is that what they need? Is that<br />
	my worth to you? Oh, there: such a whine demands its own indent! No,</p>

	<p>our wall is his bricks, my paint. They might as well say: trawl<br />
	the skies for clouds shaped like father faces. Should I be blamed<br />
	for not tattooing "prosopagnosia" across my brow. Where's the joy<br />
	in sharing facts before the comedy-tragedy-farces develop &ndash; ah, yeah,<br />
	right there! The poem resolves: <b><i>"I + You != 'blue';"</i></b><br />
	&hellip; enjoy!</p>
