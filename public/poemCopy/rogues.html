<div aria-label="Poem body">
	<p>A grift of sunshine teases bulbs to bloom<br />
	through snow, whose cold wheeze huffs<br />
	through a jemmied window; men with badges<br />
	paint the frame, looking for clues. Who<br />
	dumped the fridge across the driveway,<br />
	let its vapours heist ozones from the sky?<br />
	Breeze-blocks hold up a car where kids<br />
	play out their game of cops and fathers &ndash;<br />
	they'll harvest the world for a laugh.</p>
