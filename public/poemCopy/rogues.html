<p>A grift of sunshine teases bulbs to bloom<br />
through snow, whose cold wheeze huffs<br />
through a jemmied window; men with badges<br />
paint the frame, looking for clues. Who<br />
dumped the fridge across the driveway,<br />
let its vapours heist ozones from the sky?<br />
Breeze-blocks hold up a car where kids<br />
play out their game of cops and fathers &mdash;<br />
they'll harvest the world for a laugh.</p>
