<p>Sayeed is the checkpoint leader: <br />
he stands proudly before his rubbled halt. <br />
Comrades in turn approach his barricade <br />
so he can bar their path with his metal crutch. <br />
Sweet wrappers and leaflets serve for passes &ndash; <br />
each is produced with the correct degree of fear. </p>

<p>Abdullah appears too confident: <br />
he is an American and cannot be stopped. <br />
Sayeed is unimpressed. Americans are devils. <br />
Abdullah is denounced &ndash; infidel. <br />
And then shot. Bang! </p>

<p>Abdullah's brother argues for a kidnap: <br />
tie Abdullah hand to hand <br />
and guard him within a cellar <br />
&ndash; Abdullah is not loved by his brother. </p>

<p>Noor is a nurse again: <br />
with her doll to help, she patches Abdullah's wounds. <br />
She uses leaflets as pads and strings as bandages <br />
and folded magazines to make the splint <br />
&ndash; tricks learnt when the torpedoed flats <br />
were felled one morning, and Sayeed lost his foot. </p>

<p>Coup! No warning. <br />
Abdullah's brother wants to be leader. <br />
When he doesn't fall upon Abdullah's shot, <br />
Sayeed's crutch cracks to the brother's head. <br />
The brother retreats, tearful, <br />
trailed by Noor &ndash; bandage to hand. <br />
Then Sayeed and Abdullah grin to each other, <br />
kinsmen in arms once more, <br />
and return to the game.</p>
