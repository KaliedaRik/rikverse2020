	<p>I've never had my heart broken. Never<br />
	felt my chest pressed between iron<br />
	when someone whispers go away;<br />
	get lost. Or that malicious fib: maybe<br />
	some time apart will make us stronger &ndash;<br />
	no. Those are the words that put boots<br />
	in my brain, set blood in my face; how<br />
	can such small words sideline my thoughts<br />
	into an endless loop of <i>why, why, why?</i></p>

	<p>Iâ€™ve lied, too. That lad whose laugh<br />
	went from intriguing to embarrassing<br />
	in a week; the (many) men whose beauty<br />
	grew alongside the level of phenols<br />
	chugging my blood &ndash; I think I remembered<br />
	to thank them; us uglies need to be kind.</p>

	<p>You can break my head. Sometimes you<br />
	do it daily: selective listening; a thoughtless<br />
	word &ndash; just as I can tighten your springs<br />
	and set you up for argument. We own<br />
	each other's remote control and, when bored,<br />
	the fun of channel-surfing through emotions<br />
	and reactions is too tempting to refuse. Such<br />
	is the life we have both embraced, eyes open.</p>
