<p>I've never had my heart broken. Never<br />
felt my chest pressed between iron<br />
when someone whispers go away;<br />
get lost. Or that malicious fib: maybe<br />
some time apart will make us stronger &mdash;<br />
no. Those are the words that put boots<br />
in my brain, set blood in my face; how<br />
can such small words sideline my thoughts<br />
into an endless loop of <i>why, why, why?</i></p>

<p>I’ve lied, too. That lad whose laugh<br />
went from intriguing to embarrassing<br />
in a week; the (many) men whose beauty<br />
grew alongside the level of phenols<br />
chugging my blood &mdash; I think I remembered<br />
to thank them; us uglies need to be kind.</p>

<p>You can break my head. Sometimes you<br />
do it daily: selective listening; a thoughtless<br />
word &mdash; just as I can tighten your springs<br />
and set you up for argument. We own<br />
each other's remote control and, when bored,<br />
the fun of channel-surfing through emotions<br />
and reactions is too tempting to refuse. Such<br />
is the life we have both embraced, eyes open.</p>
