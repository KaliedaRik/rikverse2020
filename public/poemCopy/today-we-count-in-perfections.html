	<p><i>One for a wish, two for a kiss ...</i><br />
	My first wart grew where my fingers would cross,<br />
	tight in the web; a new knuckle quick to fist<br />
	for battle. Friends asked: "who was the witch?"<br />
	We spied on playtime supervisors for evidence<br />
	of brooms, checked teacher's pockets for toads.</p>

	<p><i>Three for a letter, four for something better ...</i><br />
	I grew a style, once, to block out the world<br />
	from my eye. I would wake early to admire<br />
	the gathering puss that pressed out the lid<br />
	and patch my face with a pirate's jewel. "Who<br />
	was the witch," asked friends. "Give us your rum!"</p>

	<p><i>Five for silver, six for gold ...</i><br />
	I saved my impetigo for adulthood, and spread<br />
	it wide across my jaw with each fresh shave.<br />
	A mate said: "why have you been looking<br />
	under toilet doors?" Idiot: that's cold sores<br />
	and the boon of this rash is I can sprinkle it dry.</p>

	<p><i>Seven for a secret never to be told ...</i><br />
	Do I regret those drunken lusts? Yes<br />
	&ndash; and yet: no.</p>
