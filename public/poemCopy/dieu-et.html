<p>We knew it would happen; I know that life<br />
ends: that animated flesh must fall still<br />
and silent. Skin cannot heal forever.</p>

<p>I never met her, yet she was our constant;<br />
forever there, the national Mum, then Gran -<br />
the woman in chameleon skin who took<br />
whatever shape we needed for that season.<br />
She who walked among us, welcomed us<br />
into her gardens for our good deeds<br />
and rewarded us with ribbons and medals<br />
and brief, kind phrases. She who sat<br />
on that rampant throne of gilt and read<br />
the acts of governance back to politicians.<br />
She who spoke to us each Christmas Day,<br />
reminding us of resonant words: faith, duty,<br />
respect, hope, love ... her smile sweet<br />
as she spoke the words written for her,<br />
lines scripted for our control while her skin <br />
camouflaged the woman within.</p>

<p>The clouds cried as the news blustered<br />
its escape from Balmoral's turrets.<br />
She's dead, repeats a flat man on a screen<br />
over and over and over again: she's dead<br />
and we must celebrate her just like the sky,<br />
signalling her end with rainbows over Windsor.</p>

<p>I never met her; I never knew the shape of her,<br />
the truth of her and yet I grieve and wish<br />
her family well - today at least. A great vase<br />
that stood proud in our collective hall<br />
and weathered the passage of the masses, gathering<br />
a chip here and a crack there, has toppled:<br />
we cannot glue her back together; we can't gloss<br />
this damage to suit our needs. She's dead<br />
and all the needs we poured into her now spoil<br />
and stain the carpet and no flat man or woman<br />
can say sufficient words to scrub that mess clean.</p>

<p>She's dead, this woman I never met and yet knew<br />
but never knew. The world stops, carries on.<br />
I walk through supermarket aisles as her flesh<br />
wends its way past heather, hearsing towards<br />
Edinburgh. Soldiers who dodged Afghan bullets<br />
rehearse parading her flag-wrapped flesh as I<br />
find milk to buy: <i>"A penny more than last week!"</i><br />
a stranger tells me, her trolly packed<br />
with bargain offers and microwave meals because<br />
<i>"They're cheaper to cook!"</i> - a useful lesson<br />
I already know. We queue together, friends<br />
for a moment, no more, then separate to pay<br />
- faithful in our checkouts, hopeful<br />
the machines will respect the balances<br />
recorded in our debit cards: I haven't used<br />
her face for cash in years.</p>
