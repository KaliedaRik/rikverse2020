<p>"Each step I take moves me from night to day; <br />
I know that I must learn of night and day.</p>

<p>"This hill imprisons me &ndash; my heart has fled; <br />
I see only ice: it churns night and day.</p>

<p>"What greater gift can these cold mists give me? <br />
Knowledge of how to burn this night to day.</p>

<p>"I never found my love, though I touched his shape; <br />
mistrust has been my friend: spurn night for day.</p>

<p>"An old sheep's skull, some ribbons, beads and nails; <br />
this unloved garbage returns night to day?</p>

<p>"My name is Snowdrop, born from love now lost; <br />
I beg of you: adjourn this night, make day!"</p>
