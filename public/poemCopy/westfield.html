	<p>My Lord, we have built again<br />
	your city: Akhetaten's towers<br />
	and parades, its regal temples<br />
	rise anew from slums. Your Valley<br />
	of the Lea shall host a crush<br />
	of heroes, statues cast<br />
	in tinted mint obsidian<br />
	to spatter-catch your heat;<br />
	each ray you stretch to us<br />
	we grasp and use to form<br />
	the holy signs: Monsoon<br />
	and Nike; Prada, Gucci<br />
	&ndash; our love is near complete.</p>
