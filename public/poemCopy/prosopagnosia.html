<p>On good days all I see are mouths. Some pout,<br />
some chew. A yawning maw is an adventure<br />
with crampons and ropes. Smirks are welcome;<br />
smiles often false. Beards lag the lies within.</p>

<p>Other times are less fortunate: a morning<br />
spent in the company of walking noses can trip<br />
me to madness &ndash; how can the shapes of snouts<br />
be so infinite? Such colourful vents to the soul.</p>

<p>One time I walked among flocks of brows perched<br />
on foreheads. Once I skipped through henge-fields<br />
of chins. Sometimes I see only a swirl of palettes<br />
that slowly churn, topped by the occasional hat.</p>

<p>I have no control over what my stuttering mind<br />
will choose to specify. My horror is a surround<br />
of eyes &ndash; all stare and know and judge, dismiss &hellip;<br />
except yours, my love. Only yours can I trust.</p>
