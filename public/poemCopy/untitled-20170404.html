<p>That moment between the brown of daffodils<br />
and the long of first-trimmed grass; that place<br />
when each day the magpie nest masses in sticks;<br />
the time just as leaves curl us in green &mdash; then:<br />
I'll tumble to your side right then and lap you<br />
in hugs and together we'll widen<br />
our beaks in song.</p>
