<div aria-label="Poem body">
	<p>That moment between the brown of daffodils<br />
	and the long of first-trimmed grass; that place<br />
	when each day the magpie nest masses in sticks;<br />
	the time just as leaves curl us in green &ndash; then:<br />
	I'll tumble to your side right then and lap you<br />
	in hugs and together we'll widen<br />
	our beaks in song.</p>
