<p>Evening arrives with a clear sky and a hard frost <br />
to etch white glass scabbards on each grass blade.</p>

<p>Horses graze in their stables, too cold to start<br />
at my dog, running her rheumatic hip to warm ease.</p>

<p>Your caravan is warm &ndash; chilblains itch when I enter. You force<br />
your bones to stand, to greet me: our backslaps hug us tight.</p>

<p>We speak easily this evening: records and radios,<br />
school, work, food and fodder. Other men's wives.</p>

<p>You mention doctors, a bladder infection. No fright<br />
in your voice, a rare acceptance of your current state.</p>

<p>An odour vents from under the sink. A commode of piss<br />
and clotting blood. No worry, you say: herbs will clean the air.</p>
