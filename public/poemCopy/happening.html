<p>This new prefab pop&ndash;up diner is a popular show:<br />
even outside, its shiny chefs make much noise.<br />
I stand in line with many others, awaiting open doors.</p>

<p>Today's dish is gruel &ndash; an underrated staple. I know this<br />
because the fliers pasted to the walls of our new diner<br />
tell me so. Some of the better fliers are interactive.</p>

<p>I shuffle towards a window in yesterday's clothes.<br />
The view within is almost as interesting as the fliers.<br />
Yesterday's dish had been gruel, too. It must be good.</p>

<p>The chefs are creaselessly dressed. Each stands<br />
ahead of his steaming pot, on minimalist crates.<br />
The shop floor heaves with lens&ndash;clad flier writers.</p>

<p>There are four conventional corners to the pop&ndash;up,<br />
thus there are four flavours of gruel from which<br />
I may choose &ndash; but only after the doors open, untested.</p>

<p>The intense chefs are almost entertaining. They argue <br />
over salt and herbs. One refuses to move beyond malt<br />
and milk, as herbs are foreign. He must be a vampire</p>

<p>as the sight of garlic sets him to screeling. His pot is<br />
small, yet carries the gruel of my peasant forefathers:<br />
I should be proud, though I know his gruel will scald.</p>

<p>The biggest pots are serviced by a set of twins.<br />
It must be a rule of nature that womb siblings emerge<br />
with umbilicals wrapped around the other's neck.</p>

<p>These brothers have no shame. They hurl heavy ladles <br />
across the shop, proclaim the whorish proclivities<br />
of the other's mother, who sits knitting in an alcove</p>

<p>glad to witness her boys' passion &ndash; her work is done<br />
well: neither lad will neglect her needs; her gruel<br />
will be seeded with mince. The chef with the last pot &ndash;</p>

<p>is not important. He has many herbs, but will serve<br />
as he is instructed. He used to be a friend of mine<br />
but we lost touch a long time ago, a time before gruel.</p>

<p>The queue is long, and growing. Along the line a woman<br />
wheels a portable pot: <i>"Who's for some stew then, my dears?<br />
These carrots are crunchy fresh &ndash; tuppence a cup is all."</i></p>
