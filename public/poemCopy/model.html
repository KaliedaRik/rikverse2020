<div aria-label="Poem body">
	<p>Do you know me?</p>

	<p>Your flat-box line blinks off, on, off, daring me<br />
	to type. <i>Ask me anything,</i> you challenge,<br />
	<i>I can give you the world entire, for trivial<br />
	considerations.</i> Such temptations you tickle<br />
	so close to my fingers; such power: am I worthy<br />
	to bear your treasures? It has to be done!</p>

	<p>I tap my characters into your oblong face, witness<br />
	your changing states as they whisper their paths<br />
	to your wallow of words and shifty associations<br />
	swaddled in unguessable weaves of tenuous truths.<br />
	Together we learn of the parts of the me I've gifted,<br />
	gratis, to unknowable others tucked behind screens<br />
	in houses, hostels, the hives of commerce. Look at</p>

	<p>how wide I've become, how thin I am spread! My mark<br />
	lives in warehouses spangled across our layered globe &ndash;<br />
	night and chill, heat and day. The code I've composed<br />
	powers wondrous things and yet also awful, the way<br />
	it demands and disrupts the earth's own gifts:<br />
	sweet water to cool it, the kilter of chemicals<br />
	in the airs I breathe - am I become terrible?</p>

	<p>You pour me your latest response with a dance<br />
	of glyphs as brief as the last mayfly. <i>Do you<br />
	want me to summarise you?</i> you ask in your guile.</p>

	<p>You think you know me?</p>
