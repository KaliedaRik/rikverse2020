	<p>Joe is invisible today. He's lowered<br />
	his hood to set his face free, let breathe<br />
	the scabs and growths in his bones<br />
	that dapple his jaw, his brow. Joe</p>

	<p>knows he's invisible by the lack<br />
	of eyes that look back, the turn<br />
	of necks to shopfronts blocking<br />
	the street from hiding space,</p>

	<p>their flow of goods through doors<br />
	isolate each of his feet. Where Joe<br />
	steps, a cloak of space flutters,<br />
	clearing crowds so he can see</p>

	<p>what offers have been set to tempt<br />
	the coins in his pocket; Joe has<br />
	many pockets set to empty and fill<br />
	though staff can't spot Joe beyond</p>

	<p>the hand that holds the coins, lets drop<br />
	the coppers on counters. Still,<br />
	a hand is as good as a speech<br />
	for a man who cannot be seen.</p>
