	<p>A friend of the family had a donkey<br />
	whose stone coat would change hue<br />
	to measure the weather. He said<br />
	the tail would part from her arse to mark<br />
	the start of an earthquake.</p>

	<p>A blue-vein, wet, windstrap day<br />
	takes me walking broad Dymchurch Wall.<br />
	The wave chopped sea ebbs, exposes the renovated<br />
	sands and shingles where cousins once exercised<br />
	donkeys on winter days like this. I'd run, too,<br />
	with my dog. Watch as she chased seagulls<br />
	through the gusts. You never chased me here:</p>

	<p>this beach was my beach. Renewed<br />
	each day by the grey Channel tide. Bright<br />
	shells to collect, rank kelps to kick. A time<br />
	for thoughts to tick in my head. Navigate<br />
	between sand and silt, land in water quick<br />
	to suck a foot deep. But today</p>

	<p>I keep to the wall, walk away from the village,<br />
	balance between brown fields below the tide line<br />
	and the salt foams beyond my yellow strand. I balanced<br />
	too long. Settled, like the wall, between you and the wife<br />
	strapped in your coastcarving, shapeshift battle.<br />
	Waiting for the brush of a donkey's tail,<br />
	detached.</p>
