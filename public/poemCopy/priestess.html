<p>A friend of the family had a donkey<br />
whose stone coat would change hue<br />
to measure the weather. He said<br />
the tail would part from her arse to mark<br />
the start of an earthquake.</p>

<p>A blue-vein, wet, windstrap day<br />
takes me walking broad Dymchurch Wall.<br />
The wave chopped sea ebbs, exposes the renovated<br />
sands and shingles where cousins once exercised<br />
donkeys on winter days like this. I'd run, too,<br />
with my dog. Watch as she chased seagulls<br />
through the gusts. You never chased me here:</p>

<p>this beach was my beach. Renewed<br />
each day by the grey Channel tide. Bright<br />
shells to collect, rank kelps to kick. A time<br />
for thoughts to tick in my head. Navigate<br />
between sand and silt, land in water quick<br />
to suck a foot deep. But today</p>

<p>I keep to the wall, walk away from the village,<br />
balance between brown fields below the tide line<br />
and the salt foams beyond my yellow strand. I balanced<br />
too long. Settled, like the wall, between you and the wife<br />
strapped in your coastcarving, shapeshift battle.<br />
Waiting for the brush of a donkey's tail,<br />
detached.</p>
