<p>Beneath the moil of muddied pelts<br />
a bloody hock beats and strikes out;<br />
tremors stammer the spattered hoof<br />
which stills, and falls. A feral man<br />
strides through the pack, plucking the dogs <br />
away from their kill by kicks and growls<br />
to slide his flint through sinews, let free<br />
blood from the neck &mdash; a newsprung brook <br />
bustles downhill. He barks a command<br />
at the bickering hounds, their hackles bristled <br />
as they fight for the right to feast on offal.</p>

<p>He tugs and straps the stag with twine, <br />
drags the carcass from its couch of brambles <br />
to pull it uphill, the pinioned hooves <br />
sketching a line through the litter and sod.<br />
It was a great stag, its grey muzzle<br />
scarred with the thrusts of thrashing antlers <br />
through many ruts. A muddied tongue<br />
slugs over leaves; the last of its spoor<br />
beads the tousled baton of its tail.</p>

<p>A snick of a twig stops all activity &hellip;</p>

<p>In moments men are moving, running.<br />
They loop in lines through larch and aspen<br />
to track the source of the sound in the copse. <br />
Dogs snout through ferns, snuffle and forage <br />
for a scent of intruder: terror; escape!<br />
When a puppy trips and pitches at her feet <br />
she screams &mdash; a snarl; a sprint; a leap!</p>

<p class='ml-6 italic'>Danger! Danger! Dogs on the loose! <br />
Teeth on the throat! Tearing and ripping!</p>

<p>And the girl is caught in the grasp of a man, <br />
pinched in his biceps, a blade at her neck.</p>
