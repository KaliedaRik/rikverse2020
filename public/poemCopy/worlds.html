<p>A long while later I found<br />
your sixties-style wetsuit, rubber<br />
disintegrating as quick as I touched it:<br />
an aged, grey skin of yours.</p>

<p>You told me you did it for the peace.<br />
Diving was your release from the noise<br />
of the world. You took me with you,<br />
sometimes, to the flooded gravel quarries<br />
at Hythe, or Lydd, with your friends.<br />
Land-safe, I would watch you<br />
skin-up, strap bottles to your back<br />
and a mask to your face, wave,<br />
and then sink. Gone from sight,<br />
your bubble stream diminishing<br />
until no sign remained<br />
of your place<br />
in that lake.</p>

<p>I'm gay, Dad.</p>

<p>There. Said it now. I bet you're spinning<br />
in your plastic ash pot. You, who made it<br />
your life's remit to refurbish the female half<br />
of East Kent: no wife safe from your guile.</p>

<p>I'm gay, and I can't swim, and I've never<br />
had a driving lesson in my life. I live<br />
in the biggest city I can find and still<br />
it's your exact face that stares back<br />
from the mirror - except for my mother's<br />
eyes. Like I'm bound within your skin,<br />
no escape, none sought now. I am your legacy,<br />
you my history. Done and dusted.<br />
Stored with love.</p>

<p>One day I will drive back to Romney Marsh, dive<br />
deep into that pit. Check for myself our depths.<br />
Watch my bubbles heave towards the surface, <br />
perhaps to leave a trace, perhaps not.<br />
But not yet. London calls me:<br />
no man is safe <br />
from our smile.</p>
