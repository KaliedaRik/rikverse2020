	<p>A long while later I found<br />
	your sixties-style wetsuit, rubber<br />
	disintegrating as quick as I touched it:<br />
	an aged, grey skin of yours.</p>

	<p>You told me you did it for the peace.<br />
	Diving was your release from the noise<br />
	of the world. You took me with you,<br />
	sometimes, to the flooded gravel quarries<br />
	at Hythe, or Lydd, with your friends.<br />
	Land-safe, I would watch you<br />
	skin-up, strap bottles to your back<br />
	and a mask to your face, wave,<br />
	and then sink. Gone from sight,<br />
	your bubble stream diminishing<br />
	until no sign remained<br />
	of your place<br />
	in that lake.</p>

	<p>I'm gay, Dad.</p>

	<p>There. Said it now. I bet you're spinning<br />
	in your plastic ash pot. You, who made it<br />
	your life's remit to refurbish the female half<br />
	of East Kent: no wife safe from your guile.</p>

	<p>I'm gay, and I can't swim, and I've never<br />
	had a driving lesson in my life. I live<br />
	in the biggest city I can find and still<br />
	it's your exact face that stares back<br />
	from the mirror - except for my mother's<br />
	eyes. Like I'm bound within your skin,<br />
	no escape, none sought now. I am your legacy,<br />
	you my history. Done and dusted.<br />
	Stored with love.</p>

	<p>One day I will drive back to Romney Marsh, dive<br />
	deep into that pit. Check for myself our depths.<br />
	Watch my bubbles heave towards the surface, <br />
	perhaps to leave a trace, perhaps not.<br />
	But not yet. London calls me:<br />
	no man is safe <br />
	from our smile.</p>
