<div aria-label="Poem body">
	<p>For my first burlesque in the warm May sun<br />
	I seek an audience of crows; there is much<br />
	for me to expose and, when done, they caw<br />
	an appreciation for my leisure-spun girths.</p>

	<p>I libate with oils, wheel onto my back<br />
	and let Aten's fingers massage me: <i>I see<br />
	you've fattened well, little calf,</i> the lost god<br />
	whispers; <i>I accept this singe of a gift.</i></p>
