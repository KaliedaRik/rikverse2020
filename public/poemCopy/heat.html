<div aria-label="Poem body">
	<p>It spackles my winter-worn face<br />
	like a blessing sent from blue<br />
	skies; how my hooping thoughts<br />
	have tried to remember this touch!<br />
	Tomorrow clouds shall weep, air<br />
	gather its weight to push me back<br />
	to my knees but here, now, I have<br />
	wide arms and flesh naked in sags<br />
	and I must dance, dance like life!</p>
</div>
