<p>If the cholera had achieved its aim to drain the last drops<br />
from Nikola's guts, or that boxcar blast had cooked<br />
Thomas's flesh to char, or Michael had not apprenticed<br />
as a bookbinder or &ndash; worse &ndash; had let the better bred<br />
beat him back to his trade, then I would have to handwrite </p>

<p>these lines by candle flame. No bulb to glow, nor switch<br />
to spark it alive; no wires or waves to scrunch space<br />
through time and tie lovers together. The ink in my quill<br />
a day's labour, the paper a week's hunger and yet I would pay<br />
again, again to scratch out these Hallmarked words</p>

<p class='strophe-indented-with-italics'>you are my purpose,<br />
my pulse, my breath<br />
and my love</p>

<p>because never can I imagine a life of mine where you are not<br />
the root of it. Here I am, the one who thrives in the midst<br />
of your infection, your flames; a man immune to the sneers<br />
of know-alls, gladly annealed to his fate to stay strangely<br />
entangled in your electro-magnetic, magnificent charm.</p>
