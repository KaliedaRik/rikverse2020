	<p>I cracked the foundation of Mum's love. Ten weeks<br />
	after you smashed her face, I stopped running.<br />
	I told her, with my teenage certainty, no more<br />
	sofa beds, guest rooms, launderettes. She didn't cry.</p>

	<p>You said: the sun shines on the righteous, when I<br />
	asked to come back. That you had won. Mum <br />
	negotiated her return two days later, her <br />
	conditions set out in a quiet, even tone. </p>

	<p>This isn't home anymore. It's like the house <br />
	has grown a new front door. I check each knock <br />
	and redirect visitors to you hiding in headphones <br />
	in the dining room, or to Mum chat-polishing<br />
	friends in our lounge. </p>

	<p>I go out more: meet friends each evening <br />
	by the storm-worn shelter on the seawall, no longer <br />
	the big prize, nor your referee.</p>
