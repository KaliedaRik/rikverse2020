	<p>We were too drunk, that first time, a mix<br />
	of wines and beers and petrol-fume tequila<br />
	salting our clown attempts to joust meat &ndash;<br />
	no, this thing we share is not that thing.</p>

	<p>We found it later, this thing we share,<br />
	in a different dive. It twisted slowly<br />
	from our mouths &ndash; a fine-wrought choke,<br />
	each phrase or joke a link to chain us close.</p>

	<p>Don't get me wrong. Our thing is love<br />
	as much as tree is wood or mud is dust.<br />
	There was no grace in our attempts to find<br />
	that thing together: <i>"my mate fancies you!"</i></p>

	<p>I still share this thing, though he is gone<br />
	from me. See? Here it is! Our secret tongue<br />
	of trigger words hoop in my ear each time<br />
	I window-shop for never-trade: tasty cock!</p>
