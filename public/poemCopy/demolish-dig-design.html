at the site of the 2012 Olympic Park, Stratford)</p>

<div aria-label="Poem body">
	<p>Each day a fresh terrain: dirt-yellow ants<br />
	bite through soils, their tracked mandibles<br />
	levelling hills, shaping plains to make<br />
	a new thing &ndash; a venue; a stage; a belief.</p>

	<p>One lifts a sod, lets sunshine pitch<br />
	through a skull's orbit &ndash; the world<br />
	had spun our star three thousand times<br />
	since this bone's last East End breath.</p>

	<p>Mighty legends shall erupt from the land,<br />
	the hoardings say, once waste is cleared &ndash;<br />
	derelicts razed, bricks recycled, hopes renewed.<br />
	Great dreams must lance from fresh skulls.</p>
