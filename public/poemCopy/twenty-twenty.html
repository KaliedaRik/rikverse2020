<p>I have a chip that lets me palm<br />
my way through gates and barriers<br />
unhindered; journeys happen. Cars<br />
appear at fingersnap, their calm</p>

<p>dispatch a pleasure bought online<br />
unseen, but checkable by app &mdash;<br />
a happy state, this wiretap.<br />
My shopping list emits its whine</p>

<p>and groceries appear, their health<br />
and mine an algorithm's dance<br />
towards a peak perfection. Chance<br />
is banished here, this land where wealth</p>

<p>is guaranteed alongside God &mdash;<br />
for God is in the cloud today<br />
as is my right to sleep and play<br />
and trade my pleasures freely: slot</p>

<p>me in for more celebrity &mdash;<br />
such gossip feeds me well and keeps<br />
the worry-mongers safe asleep<br />
inside my skull. They must not see</p>

<p>such deviance, those spies and eyes<br />
that track my worth and map my steps<br />
&mdash; ten thousand more to win that prize!<br />
I must not break the rhyme &mdash; objects</p>

<p>unwilling to comply shall be<br />
assaulted, mocked and shamed. Each day<br />
the same: the bus the work the play<br />
the sex the words my thoughts &hellip;</p>
