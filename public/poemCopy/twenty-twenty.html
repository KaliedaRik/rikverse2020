<div aria-label="Poem body">
	<p>I have a chip that lets me palm<br />
	my way through gates and barriers<br />
	unhindered; journeys happen. Cars<br />
	appear at fingersnap, their calm</p>

	<p>dispatch a pleasure bought online<br />
	unseen, but checkable by app &ndash;<br />
	a happy state, this wiretap.<br />
	My shopping list emits its whine</p>

	<p>and groceries appear, their health<br />
	and mine an algorithm's dance<br />
	towards a peak perfection. Chance<br />
	is banished here, this land where wealth</p>

	<p>is guaranteed alongside God &ndash;<br />
	for God is in the cloud today<br />
	as is my right to sleep and play<br />
	and trade my pleasures freely: slot</p>

	<p>me in for more celebrity &ndash;<br />
	such gossip feeds me well and keeps<br />
	the worry-mongers safe asleep<br />
	inside my skull. They must not see</p>

	<p>such deviance, those spies and eyes<br />
	that track my worth and map my steps<br />
	&ndash; ten thousand more to win that prize!<br />
	I must not break the rhyme &ndash; objects</p>

	<p>unwilling to comply shall be<br />
	assaulted, mocked and shamed. Each day<br />
	the same: the bus the work the play<br />
	the sex the words my thoughts &hellip;</p>
