<p>Once I found a waterfall.<br />
I watched the kingfisher perched on his rock.<br />
With a blue flume he dove deep to the abyss<br />
and surfaced with gaping bream in his beak.</p>

<p>I started &mdash; and stalled.<br />
A fear of water caressing the face<br />
held me as a stringed mannequin<br />
&mdash; shrinking the bollocks as again<br />
the kingfisher wet his oval head.</p>

<p>Perched on his rock after,<br />
one feathered eye spoke:<br />
<i>scared of the waters?</i></p>

<p>Maybe a muscle rippled, as slowly<br />
a shirt was un-burdoned and dropped.<br />
A quick circle of glancing stare<br />
was touched on the barricade trees<br />
as button-holes puckered their mouths wide,<br />
and the denims fell &mdash; expertly crumpled.</p>

<p><i>Dive!</i> The beak chattered. <i>Dive to touch the stones<br />
where the glass Sargasso elvers grow,<br />
eating worms.</i></p>

<p>And I dared. As a pink walrus<br />
tattooed here and there with hair on hide,<br />
I plunged within the waterfall pool:<br />
and mouthed a scream for shock<br />
as my bubbles were lifted to the pond-skater home.</p>

<p><i>Cold!</i> The airspheres bellowed. <i>Free!</i></p>
