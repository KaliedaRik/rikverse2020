    <p class="level-with-top">Once I found a waterfall.<br />
    I watched the kingfisher perched on his rock.<br />
    With a blue flume he dove deep to the abyss<br />
    and surfaced with gaping bream in his beak.</p>

    <p>I started &ndash; and stalled.<br />
    A fear of water caressing the face<br />
    held me as a stringed mannequin<br />
    &ndash; shrinking the bollocks as again<br />
    the kingfisher wet his oval head.</p>

    <p>Perched on his rock after,<br />
    one feathered eye spoke:<br />
    <i>scared of the waters?</i></p>

    <p>Maybe a muscle rippled, as slowly<br />
    a shirt was un-burdoned and dropped.<br />
    A quick circle of glancing stare<br />
    was touched on the barricade trees<br />
    as button-holes puckered their mouths wide,<br />
    and the denims fell &ndash; expertly crumpled.</p>

    <p><i>Dive!</i> The beak chattered. <i>Dive to touch the stones<br />
    where the glass Sargasso elvers grow,<br />
    eating worms.</i></p>

    <p>And I dared. As a pink walrus<br />
    tattooed here and there with hair on hide,<br />
    I plunged within the waterfall pool:<br />
    and mouthed a scream for shock<br />
    as my bubbles were lifted to the pond-skater home.</p>

    <p><i>Cold!</i> The airspheres bellowed. <i>Free!</i></p>
