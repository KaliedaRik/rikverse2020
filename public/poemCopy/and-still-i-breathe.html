<div aria-label="Poem body">
	<p>The sky ripened and the sun bled;<br />
	a shoal of clouds scaled like salmon<br />
	in their beaked rush to spawn. Why<br />
	does looking up empty my lungs?<br />
	Tomorrow the earth's turn will be<br />
	as surreal as every other sky-sketch<br />
	and my eyes wide like I'm two again.</p>
