	<h3>1. Before The Beginning</h3>

	<p>It starts as a web of dimensions rolled<br />
	together, a strand which He loops around<br />
	His fingers, a hammock of plans that fold<br />
	in knots to the size of an orange. Bound</p>

	<p>within are equations and constants, stuff<br />
	designed to become His new home, a place<br />
	to realise His dreams. When it's taut enough<br />
	He spins it, and &ndash; BOOM! </p>

	<h3>2. Let There Be Life</h3>

	<p>He sits in a hole in a swirl of stars,<br />
	determining chance within chains, their codes<br />
	a knot of electrons entrapped by spars<br />
	of forces He tethers in quantum modes.</p>

	<p>He blows, and the flames of a billion orbs<br />
	contort in their tubes, a magnetic flux<br />
	of notes in a chord. Something stirs: absorbs<br />
	the heat, recombines in new styles, unplucks</p>

	<p>His codes and commands. It divides, a splice<br />
	expected, and yet &ndash; He observes &ndash; unique<br />
	in ways unforseen. He relaxes, smiles,<br />
	accepts this new turn in His plan and speaks</p>

	<p>to worlds without ears: "I shall give you ears<br />
	to hear Me and eyes that shall find My love";<br />
	and scattering dust to the void He cheers<br />
	"success goes to those who believe enough!"</p>

	<h3>3. Survival Of The Fittest</h3>

	<p>It seethes &ndash; like a stew on the boil, a steam<br />
	eruption, a kite in the gale. Each cell<br />
	competes for a spot in the sun, the stream.<br />
	Detritus consumed gives an edge, a spell</p>

	<p>for breeding, expansion to cover rock<br />
	in slime, an extended affair of kin<br />
	and cousins who work as a team to stock<br />
	the pond. Soon they're cock of the shore: the kings</p>

	<p>of change. There's Jane who can taste the good<br />
	from bad; Uncle Pete who can row the tribe<br />
	through water, and Heather who eats the food.<br />
	Inside sits their ma and their pa. They scribe</p>

	<p>their names on new eggs soon to grow strange lobes,<br />
	or fins or a vascular system. Eyes &ndash;<br />
	He's waited so long for the eyes to grow.<br />
	He nudges the codes and the chemical ties,</p>

	<p>the nets in the cortex to capture the views,<br />
	the lenses that focus the light on cones<br />
	and rods that react to the strokes of hues &ndash;<br />
	designed to His plan, which is good, He knows.</p>

	<h3>4. Towards The Kingdom Of Heaven</h3>

	<p class='strophe-indented-with-italics'>They tried to convert me, but I held true!<br />
	'My Lord is my shepherd, and I'll not walk<br />
	through valley and shadow of death alone'.<br />
	They pile up the faggots in stacks around<br />
	my feet, and the crowd calls my name. 'The Pope's<br />
	own bitch &ndash; she deserves to be flamed!' But I<br />
	can see my sweet Jesus: he died for me<br />
	and I must be brave as the smoke begins<br />
	to catch in my throat. I must sing and clap,<br />
	for Heaven awaits me &ndash; I'll take this test<br />
	and suffer the torments for God, my Lord &ndash;<br />
	sweet Mary of Mercy: 'I burn! I burn!'</p>

	<h3>5. Revelation</h3>

	<p>God sits in a hole in a heap of stars,<br />
	His thoughts a device of repeating chains &ndash;<br />
	each molecule brought into time by chance<br />
	divine in its placement around His frame.</p>

	<p>The multitudes flame in their chanting praise<br />
	and steep in his aether, their souls now saved:<br />
	He made them, accepts them inside his head<br />
	though sometimes their stories upset his thread</p>

	<p>of plans and conceits that He weaves through space.<br />
	He knows about flames, He invented them:<br />
	or maybe He made the equations, braced<br />
	in sigils constraining numbers, stems</p>

	<p>consumed in a flux of exhausts &ndash; but why<br />
	would someone accept the embrace of flames?<br />
	To glorify Him? Such accounts defy<br />
	intelligent thought. Put it out, reclaim</p>

	<p>the pureness of plans. He exhales, and charms<br />
	pop in and then out of existence. Souls<br />
	arrive in their swarms: He radiates calm<br />
	and notes how their patterns depart from goals</p>

	<p>He's set them. No time now to worry: plans<br />
	can change in His scheme. There's some quarks to spin<br />
	and matter needs herding. An eye expands,<br />
	intrudes on His thought &ndash; He remembers sin,</p>

	<p>the guilt that can't hide in the eyes of those<br />
	who know they've done wrong. He invented eyes &ndash;<br />
	or maybe He set the design, exposed<br />
	those strands that became His desire for life</p>

	<p>to sunlight, and set them to seek the warmth<br />
	that bleeds from His suns, let equations build<br />
	the chemical paths and let physics form<br />
	the shape of the lens so that eyes could fill</p>

	<p>with tears and lament &ndash; such a strange result,<br />
	this gift to perceive His design! He scans<br />
	His schedules for flaws and corrects the fault:<br />
	"for all things must end, even me", He plans.</p>
