	<p>I only search for him at the weekend: <br />
	week is a time for duty, support &ndash; <br />
	tasks more important than me. <br />
	My quarry, the fox, hides his shadow in faces, <br />
	a slick flick of an eyeball down, <br />
	a stare edged across overlong <br />
	disrupting the camouflage, on trains, <br />
	across streets, quick to move on. <br />
	If my veins did not flicker, I would not know: <br />
	perhaps he was here. </p>

	<p>I traipse in search of different scenes. <br />
	Here is a bar where men converse, <br />
	words smoothing cross-grain desires. <br />
	A den the dogs have learnt to fear. <br />
	Brush safe, a form stretches in the aisles, <br />
	curls under stools, observes by tables. <br />
	Now I can see him, a proud beast, <br />
	clear at the edge on my eye. <br />
	I have his scent. He has mine. <br />
	Teeth smile.</p>
