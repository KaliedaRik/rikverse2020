<p>On the carpeted court I place the players. First you. <br />
Starting with your fist, sinews bunched across your arm,<br />
shoulders driving you to the centre of the scene. Your face <br />
is slack. Your eyes, white rimmed, say all: you know it ends here.</p>

<p>Others square up the room: brothers bursting from the sides,<br />
heroes caught standing, adrenaline barely pumped through veins. <br />
The dogs are quicker. I hang them carefully,  mid-leap now, <br />
teeth tearing the air, not caring what they attack.</p>

<p>Mum is mid-tumble towards the table that will break her fall. <br />
She doesn't scream. Her mouth slits in a grin of shock. She sees <br />
nothing, her vision blocked already by your act, the cut brow <br />
flushing red, her broken lenses hinged away from her ear.</p>

<p>I am here, too. High behind the stairwell banisters, <br />
a fifteen year face around a stretched, silent mouth. <br />
Eyes caught stranded between <i>'watch'</i> and <i>'know'</i>,<br />
trapping a tableau where two decades of seeping rage <br />
end, when the purpose for my birth fails, my family <br />
shatters, the maelstrom stops.</p>
