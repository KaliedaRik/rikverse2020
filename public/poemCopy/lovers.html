<p>Your habits are a comfort. Tonight, Tuesday, <br />
I watch you drink your six o'clock tea, slurp it <br />
from the side of your mouth. The teardrop snot <br />
dangling from your nose hypnotises me, <br />
a translucent pendulum, a gamble to guess <br />
where it will fall: the carpet, the cup.</p>

<p>The other curve of your maw clamps on<br />
a hand rolled splinter of tobacco, <br />
sucked every minute or so. Ash drops <br />
onto the pools coupon you complete, <br />
the same each week, regular ranks of crosses<br />
bet to bag a million quid: Stockport County, <br />
Manchester City, York.</p>

<p>I leave to eat in the lounge, switched to BBC. <br />
You settle where you sit, clamp headphones <br />
to your ears and zone out to ABBA, Queen: <br />
disco dazzlers who shimmer across the carpet, <br />
hips loose and hands held high. By seven your head <br />
slumps: a doze before you tour the pubs.</p>
