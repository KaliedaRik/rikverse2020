<div aria-label="Poem body">
	<p>Half ten ay em: I am surrounded<br />
	by three suits and a power skirt.<br />
	Hands are smoothed to hair and mouths,<br />
	fingers count points and derelictions,<br />
	jaws are moved rapidly,</p>

	<p>unsure of direction, but smother<br />
	insecurity from the gaze of open-plan officers:<br />
	panic is demonstrated cordially,<br />
	movements restrained, tone near-even</p>

	<p>and I am no longer centre-staged:<br />
	innocence is secured,<br />
	a reputation is sweet.</p>

	<p>I didn't lose their fucking files!</p>
