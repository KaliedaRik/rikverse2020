<p>Shall I make the wave stop mid-tumble, salt<br />
curl on a cusp of froth? Or snare the breeze<br />
in hawthorn buds, freeze street garbage into art,<br />
halt the heron leaping from her nest? Can I catch<br />
your eyes lost in that smile you share with cats?</p>

<p>I want to secure this, and this, in a chest<br />
and store them safe from harm; a charm to keep<br />
the scavenger who leaches chalk from bone<br />
at bay &mdash; but I fail. These instances lie: the wave</p>

<p>must crash, the hawthorn bloom; litter must burn<br />
as the heron's neck stretches and her wings<br />
slap rings into water. And bones must bleach &mdash;<br />
but not yet, my love, not yet! Not while<br />
the fractions between us keep our eyes wide.</p>
