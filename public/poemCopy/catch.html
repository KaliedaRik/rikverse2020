<div aria-label="Poem body">
	<p>Shall I make the wave stop mid-tumble, salt<br />
	curl on a cusp of froth? Or snare the breeze<br />
	in hawthorn buds, freeze street garbage into art,<br />
	halt the heron leaping from her nest? Can I catch<br />
	your eyes lost in that smile you share with cats?</p>

	<p>I want to secure this, and this, in a chest<br />
	and store them safe from harm; a charm to keep<br />
	the scavenger who leaches chalk from bone<br />
	at bay &ndash; but I fail. These instances lie: the wave</p>

	<p>must crash, the hawthorn bloom; litter must burn<br />
	as the heron's neck stretches and her wings<br />
	slap rings into water. And bones must bleach &ndash;<br />
	but not yet, my love, not yet! Not while<br />
	the fractions between us keep our eyes wide.</p>
