<div aria-label="Poem body">
  <p>Stand By Your Beds &ndash; I think of those words, and my mind floods with feelings of touch: ankles tight and firm in boots; the scratch of ironed wool on my arms and across my back from the shirt; the light weight of the belt cinched over my jumper and around my waist; the soft line of the beret circling my shorn skull. Opposite me I can see Carl (always Carl, never Homeboy Lad) dressed as I am, as short as I am. The two Daves stand at ease on their mats to my left, Dave the Para stock still and bored, Other Dave more twitchy.</p>

  <p>I can see Carl's display locker behind him. His cap pin on the top shelf is beginning to lean dangerously, primed to topple onto its side at first NCO glance. His socks have been folded into themselves so they smile &ndash; always smile, never frown &ndash; though a couple look a bit leery to me. Not the absolute perfect display we had all worked so hard to achieve, but not far off &ndash; he might get away with it today.</p>

  <p>There's bootsteps in the corridor, moving from one room to the next: "aTenHUN!" screams a voice, followed almost immediately with a bang as four right feet stomp down together hard on their mats. A number-rank-name-CORPORAL! comes from the mouth of the next inspectee &ndash; quite close now, next door. Our turn will be soon.</p>

  <p>My hips are bored of being so still for so long. We've been stood at ease for coming up to half an hour now, relaxed yet alert. I take a chance and move them, shift them forwards then circle them slowly around the axis of my body. </p>

  <p>"What the fuck...?" silently mouths Carl, eyes wide and warning. I know it's dangerous to move with the NCOs so close by, but needs must. I offer him a small half-grin and bring my hips back into vertical alignment with shoulders and knees. I risk a quick peek down the length of my body, searching (as ever) for stray lint. The crease ironed into my trousers looks straighter than yesterday's attempt, which is a relief, and no ghost has come to take the shine from the leather over my steel toe-caps. The floor between the four of us also gleams under the fluorescent strip light, still on as the sky beyond the window stays gloomy from thin dawn cloud.</p>

  <p>Another number-rank-name-CORPORAL!, and another. This memory is of a day beyond the earliest days when the NCOs would chew faces from skulls for minor Inspection fails; now is the time for comments on what's been done well, what could be improved. Should screaming erupt then it will be for something more serious than a toppled pin or an unsmiling sock.</p>

  <p>My gaze, as ever at this time of morning, fixes itself to just above Carl's right ear. Experience has taught me that keeping my eyes set on that point will keep my head tilted at the exact angle expected for Inspection. As a final number-rank-name-CORPORAL! sounds out I can see the edges of Carl's mouth tighten, his throat swallow and move as he prepares for his moment. I let my eyes unfocus, let my muscles relax in a gentle cascade from neck to shoulders to back to calves &ndash; as if priming myself for the sprint, the starter's gun.</p>

  <p>Boot steps in the corridor, closer now, louder...</p>

  <p>"aTEN-HUN!" â€¦ and SMACK go my fists into my thighs and BANG goes my heel on the floor.</p>

  <hr />

  <p>This is the day when we were finally allowed to march properly. Now we had boots on our feet we could smack our heels really hard into the tarmac as we stepped forward, make a proper, loud thump to announce our approach to the world. That first day's attempt was a bit ragged, but we were improving at the keeping-in-step thing with some speed. </p>

  <p>We also knew how to stand to attention, stand at ease, and stand easy. What we didn't yet know was how to transition between these positions, or how to swing our arms to the required angle as we marched, or how to salute. Even though it seemed to me like I had been in Keogh Barracks forever, that home was little more than a childhood fantasy, we had not yet had our first Drill session. I might have been dressed like a soldier, but I wasn't one yet.</p>

  <p>I discovered as I marched away from the Accommodation Block that morning that there were patterns to be found in the camouflage jackets of the men marching in front of me. It became a sport, much like cloud watching, to gaze at the back of the man in front of me (more often than not Other Dave) and identify the barking dog, the jagged butterfly or, when he overstretched his left arm forward, the hint of a woman naked on her back with pert, gravity-defying tits thrust high. </p>

  <p>Marching, I became calm. I needed those moments of calm, I welcomed them: everything else that was happening to me or around me was breathless and scary!</p>

  <hr />

  <p>That afternoon we marched ourselves onto a luxury coach, hired to transport us to Pirbright Barracks and the dental checks that awaited. This was our first time outside Keogh in an eternity of three days, thus counted as excitement.</p>

  <p>My Dentist Monster had long curly black hair and an excellent even-toothed smile &ndash; which proved she knew a good Monster of her own &ndash; and enough flesh on her bones to mark her out as a bustier kind of Monster. I opened my mouth obediently and went to my special I-Fear-No-Pain place in my head. She did some poking, scraping and measuring &ndash; the normal investigation stuff.</p>

  <p>"You visit your dentist regularly?"</p>

  <p>"Uh-uh," shaking head.</p>

  <p>"When did you last go?"</p>

  <p>I held up both hands, all digits extended.</p>

  <p>"Ten months ago?"</p>

  <p>"Uh. Ears!"</p>

  <p>"Ten years ago! Well that will explain the mess I'm seeing." I heard her words as I gazed up her nostrils. "Do you know you've got an abscess on this tooth here?" She helpfully knocked a metal prod on my all-cement tooth which, once again, was in mid-eruption.</p>

  <p>"Esh," I agreed.</p>

  <p>"It must be really painful? When did it start?"</p>

  <p>"En ears aho."</p>

  <p>She stood straight, eyes widened, giving me the opportunity to close my mouth. "Ten years?"</p>

  <p>"Yeah. It doesn't hurt though, Ma'am There's nothing left of that tooth to hurt."</p>

  <p>"Well, it's still going to have to come out. And you have a couple of cavities that need filling. And some lessons on proper oral hygiene; you really need to start looking after your teeth. Tell your people I need to see you at nine thirty tomorrow morning. Off you go now!"</p>

  <hr />

  <p>I really ought to add some background infodump to give meaning to this encounter.</p>

  <p>When I was a kid I used to visit a Dentist Monster in Hythe whom I will always think of as 'That Torturing Bastard'. Because he was a torturing bastard.</p>

  <p>One of my hobbies in my younger days was collecting phobias: wasps, water, heights, crowds, needles, etc, etc &ndash; I had a good collection of them by the time I was ten. But I never developed a phobia about going for dental checkups. I was never scared of Dentist Monsters: I hated them! There is a difference.</p>

  <p>Teeth were not a particular concern of mine; they were not part of my daily routine. My parents had tried to teach me the basics of how to brush my teeth but my view was if Bruce the Dog didn't have to clean his teeth, then why should I? They fought the battle valiantly, and soon lost. I had a toothbrush that lasted me seven years, so seldom was it used.</p>

  <p>Mum knew her responsibilities though and every Spring and Autumn, as punishment, she would drag me forcefully onto the bus to go and visit TTB. And because TTB was a torturing bastard, one visit would turn into a further three or four so he could, he claimed, fix the damage caused by my neglectful behaviour.</p>

  <p>TTB had a surgery that looked pretty much like every other torture chamber across the civilized world. There was a padded chair on a central column with a big bright moveable light above it; there was a bank of drills and tools that could be dragged across the room. There was a spittoon with pink water beside the chair. There was also the tray of needles.</p>

  <p>Needles were one of my favourite phobias: the sight of a needle would set me screaming for a good half hour. These needles were huge, and curved, and vicious enough to force me beyond the point of screaming. I would stare at them; they would stare at me.</p>

  <p>"Do you want an injection this time? It barely hurts at all and really will make things a lot easier."</p>

  <p>"NO!"</p>

  <p>He would never push the issue, maybe because the one time he had tried to force a needle into my young mouth I had punched him in the bollocks so hard he had had to take a five minute break to recover. So each time work needed to be done he would shrug his shoulders, tell me to relax and start drilling my teeth without any local anaesthetic to numb the pain.</p>

  <p>And I would take it. No screams, no tears. Because when I was very young, laid back in that evil chair, I had discovered a trick. If I gazed just past the label on the bright light TTB would pull down into my face as he worked, and if I let the thoughts stop &ndash; apart from my Mum's advice: if you ignore it, the pain will go away &ndash; a special I-Fear-No-Pain place would open up in my head, a place where I could hide and relax while the atrocities being committed in my mouth carried on.</p>

  <p>Anyways. TTB had a special favourite tooth &ndash; the first molar in my lower left jaw. Every Spring he would examine it and declare that the filling was crumbling, which meant it needed to be replaced. Which meant the filling had to be drilled out, and the cavity widened, and new filling forced into the gap.</p>

  <p>As the years went by, and Mum finally trusted me to attend my appointments unsupervised, the work on the molar became more complex. Slowly, filler replaced dentine and enamel, meaning that the cement had to be worked and shaped with strange new torture implements to supply the tooth with a high, stable grinding surface.</p>

  <p>Any decent Dentist Monster would've extracted the tooth and had done with it. Not TTB. This was his special little goldmine, supplying him with a regular source of work for which he could charge extravagant amounts to the NHS. He tended that tooth with much love and care, and I endured the horror of it all &ndash; with no anaesthetic &ndash; until that one glorious Spring day in my fourteenth year when I told him he could: "Fuck off forever, you torturing bastard!" and walked out of his surgery, and the building, never to return.</p>

  <p>That afternoon I brought a new toothbrush (and the biggest bar of chocolate I could afford) and started to clean my teeth both properly and vigorously, morning and evening. A month later the abscess under my all-cement tooth first appeared; the most pain I ever had from it was a dull ache in my jaw. </p>

  <p>And now? The termination of my ex-tooth had been ordered. And &ndash; as ever &ndash; I had a new set of appointments with Dentist Monsters to look forward to.</p>
