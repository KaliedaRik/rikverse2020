<div aria-label="Poem body">
	<p>She dabs his hot form<br />
	with damp cloths, smooths<br />
	tremors from his limbs.<br />
	<div class='lines-indented-with-italics'>I see two faces: bliss<br />
	amid the scale hide<br />
	and eyes that sing.</div>
	</p>

	<p>Zinc balms swathe blisters:<br />
	she wraps him in swaddle;<br />
	snow on a new-sown grave.<br />
	<div class='lines-indented-with-italics'>My lungs rack at<br />
	each breath. She reeks<br />
	of rose and soaps.</div></p>

	<p>Wires weave monitors to skin<br />
	and graphs dance on screens;<br />
	Her claw rests on his brow.<br />
	<div class='lines-indented-with-italics'>Cool, she is; calm.<br />
	I am at her mercy<br />
	and all is good.</div></p>

	<p>She slips away and a machine<br />
	wails an escape: his crisp<br />
	flesh shackle falls still.</p>
</div>
