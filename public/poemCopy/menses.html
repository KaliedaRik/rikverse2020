<h3>January</h3>

<p>A new year: my goodwill drains away with the dregs<br />
of a festive hangover. Today I commute by a new route.<br />
My room is lost: I lodge with family. Carpets are dustless,<br />
clothes are laundered, bedsheets are free of stain.</p>

<p>Midday, I go to the bank, obtain a statement. Count the costs<br />
and the benefits, shrug, return to work. Today's tray fills<br />
with yesterday's work. I count the hours and bend my head.<br />
Shuffle papers into folders, folders into drawers.</p>

<p>Colleagues leave after the sunlight fails. I light a cigarette,<br />
blow fumes at the door with the No Smoking sign, sit in the dark<br />
watching the tip smoulder bright when I suck. I consider options,<br />
make a choice, take a lift to the foyer and enter the night.</p>

<h3>February</h3>

<p>This one's a face. Face stands by the bar.<br />
It's raining outside. It's good to be drunk.<br />
I speak with face. He kisses my lips.<br />
Puts a hand on my groin. My groin sleeps.<br />
Fat man throws us out. My hair's wet.<br />
We howl past Trafalgar. Catch a tube east.<br />
Face plays games. Spot the shirtlifter.<br />
Laughs at the skinhead. Sucks my tongue as we sway.<br />
I vomit in Liverpool Street. Face's grin screams.<br />
We stamp in the juices. Frighten commuters.<br />
Face rubs my hand. Right in his groin.<br />
Feels good. I want to play.<br />
Face wants to sleep.</p>

<h3>March</h3>

<p>Muscles: a coverlet wraps around this source<br />
of heat, as do my legs. I wake, wipe eye-grime<br />
onto the pillow, feel the form in my grasp.<br />
I finger his stubble, watch orbs dance in their lids.<br />
Touch brings a murmur. Muscles straightens his spine,<br />
his back hairs teasing my cold nipple out.</p>

<p>Reaching down, I draw patterns with a digit<br />
across the muscled thigh that promised so much.<br />
On the ceiling foreign cracks outline alien landscapes.<br />
Night traffic herding west of London muffles through<br />
the broken double glazing. I am lost in the city:<br />
the hangover that finds me won't lead me back home.<br />
Dressing, a warm pain hints at last night's pleasures.<br />
Unheard, I move away from Muscle's life, checking<br />
change in my pocket, choosing to walk.</p>

<p>He told me he dreamed of camoflage skins,<br />
of ropes, of boots, of watersport games:<br />
I dream of tongue touch, a room of my own.</p>

<h3>April</h3>

<p>Today a lesson is learned. I learn it well.<br />
My teachers are blood tests. Four swabs and a scrape.</p>

<p>Outside I see bluebells arch in their garden.<br />
Fountain sprays swept on the breaths of the wind.</p>

<h3>May</h3>

<p>There is an empty space, man shaped, that walks by my side.<br />
Once it lived in my guts, but now I can see it<br />
when I look in the mirror, razor touched to my throat.<br />
It moves when I move, sits when I sit. It watches me crap<br />
and leans on my shoulder when I check the newspapers,<br />
looking for lets.</p>

<p>In the evenings, space and I watch a television:<br />
hold each other's hand when the pictures turn dark.<br />
As we drink cocoa, I tell it the shapes of my future room,<br />
describe the shelves of paperbacks, the pots of greenery.<br />
Carpets that don't show the dust. Sometimes we argue<br />
colour schemes, sometimes we don't.</p>

<p>I turn off the family lights and go to bed. I feel a hand<br />
on my stomach as I undress. When the duvet covers me,<br />
before I sleep, I smile to myself and renew the certainty.<br />
<i>Tomorrow,</i> my mouth shapes. Tomorrow my space<br />
will be filled by flesh.</p>
