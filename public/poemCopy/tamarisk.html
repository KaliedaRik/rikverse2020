<p class="epigraph">(After a tree in Ierapetra, Greece)</p>

<p>A feather of boughs, sweet as dawnlight<br />
above the tide line; such a frail host</p>

<p>for a god's coffined flesh, yet your heart<br />
blunts the sharpest chisel and your bole</p>

<p>pillared a palace. Could you truly feed<br />
the the chosen folk for forty lost years?</p>

<p>Who knows, a wave whispers as I watch<br />
surfs skittle amid pebbles, let your salt breath</p>

<p>tang a throat. My bones hallow your saps<br />
as they soothe my ruddy, ached joints.</p>
