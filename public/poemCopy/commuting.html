<p>Whitechapel, 8:38. We shuffle-pack onto the train, a mix <br />
of suits and office-skirts, backpacks, and I, heaping towards seats. <br />
I lose that race, and stand &mdash; my adidas joggers catching <br />
on a belted mobile phone. Its owner is young, unsure. <br />
A cute suit. I turn </p>

<p>to allow the nipples beneath my t-shirt to scrape <br />
against his off-the-hook ready-to-wear back. As the train <br />
jolts towards its tube our faces swing closer, too close: <br />
stubbled cheeks brush, lungs share air &mdash; <br />
I apologise. </p>

<p>Aldgate East, 8:40. Adverts parade the length <br />
of the carriage. I sight an army recruitment poster. <br />
Its controlled agression sits uneasy alongside <br />
the carefree cartoon dog offering cheap <br />
travel insurance ad. </p>

<p>Mansion House, 8:47. I eddy in the stream as station <br />
and train exchange bodies. My hand grabs a support strap <br />
above me as I claim space near the door. Young suit <br />
press-touches past as he exits left, eyes hidden <br />
in a yawn. </p>

<p>Blackfriars, 8:49. I rest my head on my upraised arm. <br />
I sniff my skin: salt with heat, clean, tainted by the petrol taste <br />
of rush-hour London. Chinning the flapping cloth back <br />
to the shoulder I smell the round of the muscle. <br />
I lick, </p>

<p>taking long, slow tongue strokes along the length <br />
of the arm, spit-flattening the black hairs into rows across <br />
my peach-blushed skin. The suits and skirts ignore me <br />
from the corners of their eyes. Backpackers <br />
stare. </p>

<p>St James's Park, 8:55. Escape. I stretch limbs across <br />
the platform, jog stairs. Authenticate my right to commute <br />
at the ticket barrier. I emerge to shops, crowds, <br />
delivery vans, to Victoria Street. <br />
To work.</p>
