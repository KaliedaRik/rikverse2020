<p>Look at the stag! He leaps at the trees<br />
and hoofs through the ferns, eyes wide in despair; <br />
his pelt is spattered by mud and debris<br />
as the hunters' halloos shiver the air.<br />
Look at the stag: he darts from the flares<br />
of beaters who stalk him, no time to freeze &ndash;<br />
the dogs are about him, snouts frothed as they seize <br />
his stress-shook haunch, tumble him, tear<br />
at his throat to spatter hot blood. See<br />
him, eyes wide now, dispaired.</p>

<p>Look at the feast! Great platters of meat<br />
and scuttles of beer brought to sate a fair<br />
of dancers and lovers; a barrage of treats:<br />
a pivot of swan breasts; boar heads in their pairs &ndash; <br />
look at the feast: there's ramstones to share,<br />
and manstones, and tongue-in-a-purse &ndash; discrete <br />
entrapments performed as a service replete<br />
and dulled and indifferent, each ensnared <br />
participant lost and alone. See<br />
the feast that sates the fair.</p>

<p>Look at the man! He squats by a tree<br />
and stares out the moon, mustering charms.<br />
His lap hosts a knife, its iron blade free<br />
from its yellowhorn sheath; he weaves a barm<br />
of mist from a cauldron, now seething, now calm. <br />
Look at the man as he sits on the tee<br />
of a stripy old hide, his work to decree<br />
the rise of a newly birthed sun &ndash; his arm<br />
and his song are the tools of God! See<br />
the Tallyman master his charms.</p>
