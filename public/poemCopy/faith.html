<p>His fortune lies in heaps<br />
before her front door.</p>

<p>They sit like old lovers<br />
to watch the sun paint clouds.</p>

<p class='lines-indented-with-italics'>"When we burn the offerings,<br />
do You consume the smoke?"</p>

<p>She pours them wine from the jar,<br />
drinks her portion un-watered.</p>

<p class='lines-indented-with-italics'>"I married You when I was nineteen;<br />
I was a virgin, once."</p>

<p>His hands that heal choose<br />
not to smooth her wrinkles.</p>

<p>He sips her libation, watches<br />
her eyes recycle the world.</p>
