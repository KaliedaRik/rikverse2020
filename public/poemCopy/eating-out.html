<p>When he laughs his tongue<br />
splits his lips, spider lines<br />
compressed like the accordion<br />
serenading the the diners;<br />
the veins across his bow-nose<br />
beacon his joy of fine malts.</p>

<p>Her joy is sedate, her oatmeal<br />
hands clasped to the linen<br />
where she hides her smile,<br />
her beige eyes tuned to his face;<br />
I watch her water-stretched heel<br />
stroke along the curve of his calf.</p>

<p>I carve designs on the tablecloth<br />
with the steel of my knife, quiet<br />
amid the clatter. As I wait<br />
for your late arrival I refuel<br />
on cheap house white and the sight<br />
of the waiter's tight groin.</p>
