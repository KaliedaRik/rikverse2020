	<p>When he laughs his tongue<br />
	splits his lips, spider lines<br />
	compressed like the accordion<br />
	serenading the the diners;<br />
	the veins across his bow-nose<br />
	beacon his joy of fine malts.</p>

	<p>Her joy is sedate, her oatmeal<br />
	hands clasped to the linen<br />
	where she hides her smile,<br />
	her beige eyes tuned to his face;<br />
	I watch her water-stretched heel<br />
	stroke along the curve of his calf.</p>

	<p>I carve designs on the tablecloth<br />
	with the steel of my knife, quiet<br />
	amid the clatter. As I wait<br />
	for your late arrival I refuel<br />
	on cheap house white and the sight<br />
	of the waiter's tight groin.</p>
