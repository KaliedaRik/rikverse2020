	<p>It's the way they eye you,<br />
	those two-tone bloods<br />
	perched in their manor<br />
	tree, or dance-formation<br />
	spread across the field.</p>

	<p>You have it, and they<br />
	want it, know, head<br />
	cocked, jet-eye wide<br />
	and unblinked &ndash; and what<br />
	they want, they get.</p>

	<p>You can't nursery rhyme<br />
	these feathers; the asbo<br />
	can only handle seven<br />
	&ndash; secrets never told &ndash; <br />
	I count eight, ten, twelve.</p>

	<p><i>We like the cut of you,<br />
	and your suit.</i> They caw<br />
	some chuckles as you cross<br />
	the road: <i>we'll check<br />
	your window later, mate!</i></p>
