	<p>The present you conceived for my mum<br />
	one deliberate-drunk new year's eve came<br />
	early morning, scorning your breakfast<br />
	routine. Women draped the dining room<br />
	in clean white sheets<br />
	to welcome me home.</p>

	<p>When more neighbouring wives came<br />
	to take control, you barked<br />
	&ndash; but slipped back into your manly role,<br />
	your concern no more than labourer's sweat,<br />
	soon wiped away.</p>

	<p>Your mum said it would be quick: she was right.<br />
	The screams breached barriers and I arrived, slimed<br />
	and quiet. You took me later, held nine pounds<br />
	of chaos in your grip. Only then,<br />
	mum tells me,<br />
	did I cry.</p>
