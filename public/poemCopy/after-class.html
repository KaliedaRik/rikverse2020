<div aria-label="Poem body">
	<p>After the first class, we went to the bar. Introduced<br />
	our personas by the drink in each glass. You<br />
	scared me. Eyes feared to focus on<br />
	your face, forced to look when you spoke.<br />
	Twice you smiled at my jokes. Froze<br />
	my stomach with the first grin. Melted<br />
	my legs with the repeat. I remembered<br />
	to breathe now and then.</p>

	<p>To celebrate my birthday I bought chocolates<br />
	to class, saving your favourite centres<br />
	from grabbing hands. Our hands caught<br />
	across a nut cluster: I did not shake<br />
	when you thanked me. Raised your rum<br />
	to my health. Yet your smiles are spread<br />
	evenly between classmates, and my flushes<br />
	go unnoticed in the dim light of this bar.</p>

	<p>Dozens of crumpled sheets pile by my feet.<br />
	Though we talk each week I cannot communicate<br />
	my need for your laugh, your glance. Your breath<br />
	by mine. I have even surfed wires to ask code<br />
	to generate love lines: <i>vestigal degeneration<br />
	dies triumphantly,</i> sentenced my screen. <i>Tribal<br />
	party burns expectantly.</i> As does my temple,<br />
	my forehead, my dry throat. My heart.</p>

	<p>For class tonight I have trimmed my nails.<br />
	Shaved. Taken care to crease my casual gear<br />
	to a cleaner, upmarket degree. Once study is done<br />
	we shall walk to our bar, where I shall ask<br />
	you to look at me. Notice the lust-struck wreckage<br />
	within this cool shell. Discuss my healing<br />
	in a group of two. You. Good wine. This poem,<br />
	and me.</p>
