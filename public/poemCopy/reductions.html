<p>I saw you dead, a smorgasbord<br />
of flesh arranged in a box, pine, <br />
a Blenheim I think, with loose-screwed <br />
handles for decoration. But the dead <br />
don't smile unless the corpse-artists <br />
overstuff the cheeks, and your snores<br />
were breaking my dream-threads.</p>

<p>Old man groans; I lever me upright,<br />
ignore the chest's drawers, reach for a tee<br />
from the pile at my feet. Ablutions<br />
occur by muscle. I kiss your nightsweat<br />
brow and key myself out of our house.</p>

<p>I wake at work, carriages unrecalled.<br />
There's work to be done, the gizzards<br />
of websites need fixing: look at the way<br />
that unclosed tag lets the creator's words<br />
spill out of the screen &ndash; did I code that<br />
mess? An easy fix: I have those skills.</p>

<p>We meet for lunch. You gift me a salad<br />
supermarket boxed, part of a deal. Lettuce<br />
limps from the fork like last night's tiff.<br />
"It was a stupid thing to say", I admit.<br />
Your smile frames forgiveness barely earned<br />
and yet I take it, sheath your hand in mine,<br />
show our long unboxed love to strangers:<br />
still we keep our eyes locked and embraced.</p>
