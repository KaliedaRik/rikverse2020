<div aria-label="Poem body" class="monospace-concrete">

         I bought us salad

   some crisped leaves
      to carpet
      the plate

         some beet for the rouge

   halved eggs
      as sunshine
      through clouds

   the tip of the tine
      of your fork
      pecks

         in time we chew
