	<h3>1993: Time</h3>

	<p>It is contrived to a practised degree:<br />
	laces tense across the boot, turn-ups fold<br />
	to my muscled shins. With straightened braces<br />
	and jacket shoulder slung, I take the world.</p>

	<p>Tonight, I drink alone. I lean on walls,<br />
	slips of barlight playing smiles on my face.<br />
	I sip drinks to basebeat disco rhythms<br />
	as potential sex staggers past my space.</p>

	<p>Thoughts meander &ndash; holidays, a promotion<br />
	at work. Perhaps a solid love to hold<br />
	week after week. I review the bar's crowd &ndash;<br />
	liquor improves the sight. When time is called</p>

	<p>I number my chances, mark heads to hunt:<br />
	strut into my future preening my scalp.</p>

	<h3>1991: Bruise </h3>

	<p>This mark has a tale to tell.</p>

	<p>It was not the first to be born that night,<br />
	neither the last, and it wasn't the biggest<br />
	to bloom in that bed.</p>

	<p>Its story lies in its beauty.</p>

	<p>It entered red, a heated pain racking<br />
	the thigh where it sat. Later, cooler,<br />
	it blushed darker, back-lit dark blue.</p>

	<p>Soaping my thigh, I remember its style.</p>

	<p>Oval, not round: its edges bent &ndash;<br />
	a defiant comma thumbed on the page,<br />
	creating a space in the act.</p>

	<p>Flannelling the site, I review its life.</p>

	<p>Later, it gathered a rainbow around its form,<br />
	aching azures circling maroon. Green tinged<br />
	yellows framing the stage.</p>

	<p>I tire of the tale. Towel myself dry.</p>

	<p>It ended, as all things end, healed. Sometimes<br />
	it remembers its home, a merest hint of discolour<br />
	marking its fleeting visit. Then we reflect.</p>

	<p>Relaxed, less dirty, I leave the room.</p>

	<h3>1989: Hysteria</h3>

	<p>I find him in the cave where I had left him<br />
	and beg forgiveness. His arms cross his guts<br />
	and he rocks on his heels, his thighs muscled taut.<br />
	On my knees I edge closer, almost to touch<br />
	his slack face white in the gloom. I reason.<br />
	Offer disclaimers in words choked on sorrow<br />
	but he rocks on his heels, thighs muscled taut<br />
	and breathes in and breathes out as required.</p>

	<p>I find them on a stall in Camden Market<br />
	and beg for answers. The woman takes my money<br />
	and spreads them mute across the board. I point<br />
	and demand a finish to this pain. The cards<br />
	in their symbols dance in their ranks,<br />
	claiming tales of love and money while the woman<br />
	who spreads them, mute, across the board<br />
	fails to hear my need.</p>

	<p>I find her in the sky reflecting wisdom and beg<br />
	for a word, a reason, but she will not consent.<br />
	The moon is dead, the cards lie silent<br />
	and the innocent within me<br />
	breathes and rocks.</p>

	<h3>1988: Control</h3>

	<p>Guru said: <i>Drink</i> and bottles were drunk<br />
	until the walls were buckled and a bladder grew fat.</p>

	<p>Guru said: <i>Walk</i> and a path was taken,<br />
	a door was opened and a lock was clicked shut.</p>

	<p>Guru said: <i>Desire</i> and <i>Need</i> and a bruise was applied<br />
	and clothes were torn across seams.</p>

	<p>Guru said: <i>Drop</i> and a carcass fell and a kiss<br />
	of control was fixed to a mouth.</p>

	<p>Guru said: <i>Relax. Be silent. Consent.</i><br />
	And it was done.</p>

	<h3>1994: Storm</h3>

	<p>The future I choose leads me deeper into Soho,<br />
	deep into the heat of the stagnant evening air.<br />
	As I walk St Martin's Lane and dodge between tourists<br />
	packing their way through Chinatown the skies shatter,<br />
	weaving liquid sheets across the town, reflecting my sight.</p>

	<p>Head tilted, I stand in the light of a sulphur lamp<br />
	and watch the fat gobbets drop, line after line<br />
	into my face. Tongue out, I taste their cold story,<br />
	feel the rivulets trigger scalp-nerves as they deflect<br />
	their passage around my velvet skull.</p>

	<p>When the deluge eases, I return to my purpose:<br />
	breathe the scrubbed air deep into my chest,<br />
	allow the fresh vapours time to cleanse the dark recesses<br />
	within me. I stretch, strip, accept the cool staccato<br />
	upon my flesh. Breathing out, I laugh. Then I run.</p>

	<p>Typically, I am late. When I finally arrive, we have words<br />
	though I smile as you list my faults. I apologise<br />
	with alcohol, you accept with a leer. Together we sit<br />
	and chat, watch steam heaving from my jeans to dance<br />
	with the coiling twine of your cigarette smoke.</p>

	<p>When you take my hand in yours,<br />
	I look hard at your eyes<br />
	and know trust.</p>
