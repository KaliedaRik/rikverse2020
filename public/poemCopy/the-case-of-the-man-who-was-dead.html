	<h3>Friday</h3>

	<p><i aria-label="speaker: client">"Come,"</i> she says. <i aria-label="speaker: client">"I'll show you<br />
	second hand"</i> and takes her palms<br />
	to her brow and pulls them wide:<br />
	walls crack to ooze a Levant<br />
	light around us, swirl us &ndash; here.</p>

	<p>This hill has strange trees.<br />
	<i aria-label="speaker: client">"Only three, today,"</i> she smiles,<br />
	<i aria-label="speaker: client">"I've watched them plant forests<br />
	some mornings."</i> A spring orchid<br />
	spires amid cups of blue bindweed.</p>

	<p>I see shapes in the guttering sun,<br />
	watching, long shadows restored.<br />
	<i aria-label="speaker: client">"We could not go to him; we bore<br />
	witness instead, a child of whispers:<br />
	what monsters and martyrs we birthed!"</i></p>

	<p>Almond petals spot the dry dirt<br />
	white about our feet. From the vale<br />
	wafts a sharp citrus; from the city<br />
	call the chisel taps of hasty repair.<br />
	<i aria-label="speaker: client">"Lost!"</i> she murmurs. <i aria-label="speaker: client">"I cannot move!"</i></p>

	<h3>Saturday</h3>

	<p><i aria-label="speaker: narrator">"How did you torment him?"</i> I demand.<br />
	His face is huge: an ice-wall chin calving<br />
	berg-hair; each cheek a flat tundra,<br />
	fell-field pockets grey in the chill &ndash;<br />
	his eye-caves could house nations.</p>

	<p>And as he smiles, I follow his mechanics &ndash;<br />
	oil and shape, twist and form, evolve<br />
	a frosted fret of recollections tight<br />
	across his blue lip. <i aria-label="speaker: witness">"You should ask<br />
	the one who supplied my design, perhaps?"</i></p>

	<p>He talks in gusts of air released<br />
	from glaciers &ndash; a slow whisper of gas<br />
	recalling the histories of the world.<br />
	<i aria-label="speaker: witness">"I charted the story of his message<br />
	and watched him scream, scream. Scream!"</i></p>

	<h3>Sunday</h3>

	<p><i aria-label="speaker: client">"Know this: he was a changed man<br />
	when he first returned &ndash; more solid<br />
	than the walls he walked through;<br />
	his words boiled love in my heart.<br />
	He wore his wounds like totems."</i></p>

	<p>She's changed, too. No longer<br />
	the little woman &ndash; scarf-bound,<br />
	lip-taut seeker, lost. She hunts<br />
	like she hires: with crisp bills<br />
	on wood she measures my worth.</p>

	<p>These are good notes. I measure<br />
	my questions accordingly: who<br />
	and where, and how. Not why &ndash;<br />
	the curves of her black-sheen<br />
	calves suppress my need to know.</p>

	<p>There's no noise outside, no wind<br />
	to swirl the street litter in dance,<br />
	no midnight trade, no dogs. <i aria-label="speaker: client">"He's late,"</i><br />
	she tells me. <i aria-label="speaker: client">"The world can't sing out<br />
	its rattle-tunes if he won't come home."</i></p>
