<div aria-label="Poem body">
	<p>It's strange how our fingers<br />
	interweave when we cross roads,<br />
	shop for carrots, newspapers,<br />
	cartons of milk. Sometimes</p>

	<p>I'll fold my palm around<br />
	your knuckles to keep them<br />
	warm while we wait for the bus,<br />
	or walk to town. Sometimes</p>

	<p>you knuckle my hand away: decisions<br />
	are shared in this space, we both<br />
	must agree to risk the spits<br />
	of strangers, haters, sometimes.</p>
