	<p>Peter watches his lion lie<br />
	in the bucket where he set it:<br />
	first to flare is the tuft<br />
	of the beastling's tail-tip, curled<br />
	in the pail's cylindrical seam &ndash;<br />
	its tempo twitch a cub's annoyance<br />
	at the chafe of infant constraints.</p>

	<p>Peter, too, is impatient.<br />
	He coils a smoke-rope tendril<br />
	in his lung as his toy's loin<br />
	grows tuffs of lemon-lick curls.<br />
	As a chesty ember glows and dims<br />
	and glows amid the shoddy he smiles<br />
	and shifts on his knee, and watches.</p>

	<p>The lad claps as a collar of mane<br />
	erupts from the neck &ndash; a pride<br />
	of flames set to stalk and chase<br />
	across the dry-weave carpet savannah.<br />
	His lion looks up at the sound,<br />
	lifts a paw to let the lap<br />
	of heat sharpen claws; it pounces</p>

	<p>at Peter, struggles to lever<br />
	its haunch across the melted rim<br />
	of its lair, leaps up to reach<br />
	the table hide where the boy<br />
	huddles with his matches; when<br />
	he proffers a hand to ruffle<br />
	the singed fur the toy roars &ndash;</p>

	<p>a deep rumble that sets a gale<br />
	among the bedroom curtains<br />
	and drives the angel mobile<br />
	to dance on the pins of soot<br />
	snowflakes blooming the air;<br />
	across Peter's peach-fuzz wrists<br />
	a tight new glove knits to skin.</p>
