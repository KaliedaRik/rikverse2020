	<p>My goose hisses as I walk the length<br />
	of the identity parade. The bespoke<br />
	suits of potential criminals crease<br />
	as each identikit man reaches in turn<br />
	to pet the witness; it eyes their ties<br />
	&mdash; colour coded gang tags &mdash; and rattles<br />
	its tongue in its beak as they tweak<br />
	at its tail. For this is the choice:<br />
	the spiv who pulls the most feathers<br />
	with the least noise shall win<br />
	my harlot kiss on the ballot.</p>
