	<p>They start already, a <b>!crack!</b> of chrome<br />
	on steel as each leaflet's Art<br />
	slaps through my letter slot:<br />
	happy vistas, colour-branded<br />
	futures, insta-tinctured smiles &ndash;<br />
	were these eye-shots market-tested?<br />
	That hint of wrinkled insincerity<br />
	batch rejected? See how they quarrel,</p>
	
	<p>how they quell and quench, how they use<br />
	the faintest hint of catflap draft<br />
	to puff their catchword to the peak<br />
	of the pile, deny the small-goal<br />
	take-out menu, that aged taxi card<br />
	the chance to catch my eye,<br />
	my wallet's vote. You hear them too?<br />
	I catch their rustles, triggers<br />
	in print which fold, flutter<br />
	across my hall, trip and slip<br />
	my toes as I chase them, as I heel<br />
	my weight to pin them to the floor.<br />
	Even as I crumple a fear-red rose,<br />
	a broad-brush oak, a spray of orange<br />
	strokes to emote some bird aloft &ndash;</p>
	
	<p>their inks impact, infest my skin:<br />
	memes and manifests print 'hope'<br />
	and 'fear' across my palms as I rip<br />
	and trash their ugly pulps.</p>
