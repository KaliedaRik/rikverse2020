<p>They start already, a <b>!crack!</b> as chrome<br />
bangs steel as each leaflet's Art<br />
slaps through my letter slot:<br />
happy vistas, colour-branded<br />
futures, insta-tinctured smiles &ndash;<br />
were these eye-shots market-tested?<br />
That hint of wrinkled insincerity<br />
batch rejected? See how they quarrel,<br />
quell and quench, how they use<br />
the faintest hint of catflap draft<br />
to puff their catchword to the peak<br />
of the pile, deny the small-goal<br />
take-out menu, that aged taxi card<br />
the chance to catch my eye,<br />
my wallet's vote. You hear them too?<br />
I catch their rustles, triggers
in print which fold, flutter<br />
across my hall, trip and slip<br />
my toes as I chase them, as I heel
my weight to pin them to the floor.
Even as I crumple a fear-red rose &ndash;
a child-dream's tree, some orange
lines who hint at a bird a-wing &ndash;<br />
their inks impact, infest my skin:<br />
memes and manifests print 'hope'<br />
and 'fear' across my palms as I rip<br />
and trash their ugly pulps.</p>
