<p>They've started already, words<br />
flapped through my letter slot<br />
promising me visions of futures<br />
colour-coded, branded and stamped<br />
with their picture-perfect smiles,<br />
each eye-shot market-tested &ndash;<br />
a hint of wrinkled insincerity<br />
batch rejected. They smother<br />
each other, use the faintest breath<br />
of draft to puff themselves<br />
to the top of the pile, deny<br />
the take-out fliers and taxi cards<br />
the chance to catch my eye,<br />
my wallet's vote. I hear them rustle<br />
trigger-point slogans as they flutter<br />
across my hall, trip and slip<br />
my feet as I chase them, heel them<br />
to the floor; even as I crumple<br />
roses, trees, glyphic birds,<br />
their inks infest my skin,<br />
printing memes and manifestos<br />
to my palm as I rip and bin<br />
their tired, recycled pulps.</p>
