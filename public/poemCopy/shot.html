<p>The fox is shot:<br />
I find it hidden in Victoria Street<br />
between the mists of diesel and spring.<br />
I crouch. Touch its pelt. It wakes, licks my fingers.<br />
City smog thickens, killing protest;<br />
shapes walk by, shadows of aliens.</p>

<p>I lift my eyes. See the houndsman.<br />
He lumbers towards me and kicks his prey.<br />
<i>Vermin,</i> he sneers. <i>Give it me.<br />
I'll see it's thrown to the dogs.</i><br />
My arms encircle it. Blood stains my groin.<br />
He lifts his chin, yodels: <i>Haa Whoah!</i></p>

<p>They muster beyond the brick cathedral<br />
veiled in scaffold to save its facade.<br />
The dogs pack in, tongues<br />
slavering their chests, yelps<br />
stripped from snouts fixed in fighting grins<br />
at the smell of easy work.</p>

<p>The fox would panic, but it is shot:<br />
it paws my shirt, tearing the seams.<br />
Fleas flip allegiance; hammer thumps<br />
smacking in my airless chest. <i>Obscenity,</i><br />
the dogs growl. <i>Rip it. Dirty.<br />
Not one of us.</i></p>

<p>I find a voice: <i>no,</i> I whisper. <i>Leave it be.</i><br />
Yet my eyes flinch at a bugle halloo<br />
and horsemen ride in from Parliament Square.<br />
They laugh at me. <i>Get away, lad.<br />
We have business to attend.</i><br />
Fox ears flatten: bones shiver in skins.</p>

<p><i>Bait him,</i> calls a shape from the mist.<br />
<i>Hush,</i> whispers its mate. <i>Avert your face.<br />
Move along!</i> Commands a policeman<br />
and ushers bystanders towards Victoria Station<br />
and the carriages waiting to truck them home.<br />
A helmet doffs the horsemen by.</p>

<p>Help comes from pious tones. <i>Not in front<br />
of the Lord's House,</i> choristers chant. My cry<br />
of relief is choked in incense fumes. Bishopric frowns<br />
pinpoint the fox. <i>Hate the sin. Forgive the sinner.</i><br />
The horsemen chuckle, raise their whips, slip<br />
hipflasked brandy into the shepherd's plate hands.</p>

<p>The bishop turns back to the brick stack sanctuary.<br />
The hunt advances: the fox that is shot<br />
whines it last breaths, motionless.<br />
I try to stand, escape with the fox clutched in my arms<br />
but cannot move &mdash; blood on my legs congeals<br />
like callipers: my eyes fix on sulphur fangs.</p>

<p>Disposal by numbers: first dog, snout foamed,<br />
leaps in my face. Second crushes a fox-haunch,<br />
wrenches it away from my grasp.<br />
As fox is disembowelled I watch the horsemen cheer,<br />
the bystanders jeer, I watch houndsman<br />
and policeman exchange approving looks.</p>

<p>Then they are gone. I am<br />
hidden between mists of diesel and spring<br />
in Victoria Street. With tears silent on my face<br />
I lick damp fox clots from my fingers,<br />
lick the hairs on the back of my hand.<br />
Hear Westminster bells chime, and a rifle bark</p>

<p>distant in Pimlico. Unflexing<br />
my shoulders, I pad<br />
away.</p>
