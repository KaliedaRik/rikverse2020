<p>This morning we work together: I need <br />
school books; you want beerchange. <br />
As we enter the stables to fork horse dung<br />
into corners I listen to the way you speak, <br />
flat vowels flagging statements in the flow: <br />
must have a wife, then sons come. Work <br />
for a wage to pay the rent, a roof overhead. <br />
Food on plates &ndash; yes, I nod, hungry to finish <br />
the job, straw stalk between my teeth. </p>

<p>Moving to the next job you string up <br />
more thoughts. I look to where you point: <br />
a pond hedged in yellow iris, puckered <br />
out of the marsh by bombs that failed <br />
to rocket London. We hang hay for the horses <br />
on the fence by the train tracks and I ask you, <br />
why? You sigh, remind me of familiar facts: place <br />
makes money, money makes status. Your brothers <br />
fighting out of England for fuck-knows-what <br />
and you digging roots for farmers. </p>

<p>You try to explain, how for a while it worked, <br />
the world worked but then it stopped, a man <br />
rocketed to the moon yet no-one would tell you <br />
why, or how to fix the world, except to take the pills <br />
that raked out your feelings, made you sweet <br />
like rotting hay and horse shit &ndash; clipping <br />
your sentences now to bare clause, word <br />
on word, repetitive like the piston chudder <br />
of the little train rushing past us to Dymchurch <br />
station. The smoke stings your eyes to tears <br />
and haychaff makes your lungs heave.</p>
