<p>These angularities that pin me in <br />
are pinned with cloth of woven mauve and I<br />
must pin instructions here. The plastic rails<br />
enforce confinements, one to each square cell;<br />
there are no doors. A circle sequence keeps<br />
me close, its arcs and sweeps a sturdy guard.</p>

<p>No doors &ndash; an oblong bright in blues and whites<br />
displays an arc of planes, each green and shaped<br />
identically from some machine within<br />
its pole. They wave at me: <i>look how we break<br />
from shells! Look how we swing in puffs and scuffs<br />
of molecules that buff us, stroke our dance!</i></p>

<p>No doors &ndash; I hate the dance of shapes across<br />
instructions pinned by me to my mauve cloth.<br />
They say: translate us while the arc sweeps low.<br />
I bow my head and worship; fingers pray<br />
across the coded blocks that bounce and click &ndash;<br />
my alchemies dissect some thoughts and pin</p>

<p>them on a screen that feels like silk when stroked.<br />
As sigils grow in rows I meld, become<br />
the incantation. Between the pulpy flats<br />
that hide my desk a cupid stalks, its jaws<br />
are primed to stab results together, sense<br />
from nonsense &ndash; still the fingers sweep their arc</p>

<p>across their sequenced numbers. Still I pray<br />
and my release remains a sentence away.</p>
