<div aria-label="Poem body">
	<p>An exile in paradise <br />
	weeps, hearing life, <br />
	life gone, boys with <br />
	machetes. Sliced pigs, <br />
	bullets and birdsong. </p>

	<p>Paradise seems unnoticed by a second, whose eyes <br />
	(he says) boiled when his shack was torched. <br />
	He remembers to smile when a camera is clicked. </p>

	<p>This one, pretty in a dress, <br />
	sings songs and claps hands, <br />
	shows the strangers her pictures &ndash; <br />
	fat mummies and stick daddies <br />
	with slits crayon-stitched and <br />
	bandaged with magic. Mummy will come <br />
	to paradise soon, she says. </p>

	<p>A fourth, older, wiser, <br />
	twelve, heats water <br />
	for drinking, shrinks <br />
	when the wood cracks. </p>

	<p>A soldier with no boots watches the boys <br />
	play football through the camp. He wants <br />
	to play too, but the footballers are older, <br />
	and don't know he exists. </p>

	<p>The sixth eats. <br />
	Paradise smells better <br />
	when the hunger <br />
	has gone.</p>
