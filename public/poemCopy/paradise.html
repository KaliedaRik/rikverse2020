<p>An exile in paradise <br />
weeps, hearing life, <br />
life gone, boys with <br />
machetes. Sliced pigs, <br />
bullets and birdsong. </p>

<p>Paradise seems unnoticed by a second, whose eyes <br />
(he says) boiled when his shack was torched. <br />
He remembers to smile when a camera is clicked. </p>

<p>This one, pretty in a dress, <br />
sings songs and claps hands, <br />
shows the strangers her pictures &mdash; <br />
fat mummies and stick daddies <br />
with slits crayon-stitched and <br />
bandaged with magic. Mummy will come <br />
to paradise soon, she says. </p>

<p>A fourth, older, wiser, <br />
twelve, heats water <br />
for drinking, shrinks <br />
when the wood cracks. </p>

<p>A soldier with no boots watches the boys <br />
play football through the camp. He wants <br />
to play too, but the footballers are older, <br />
and don't know he exists. </p>

<p>The sixth eats. <br />
Paradise smells better <br />
when the hunger <br />
has gone.</p>
