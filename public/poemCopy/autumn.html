	<p>This year autumn arrives in August:  <br />
	blows shit-shaded leaves past my head, <br />
	under my feet &ndash; scrunch-muffled in the rain. <br />
	Damp rots the fruit in the market, rusts <br />
	trolleys abandoned in the street. </p>

	<p class='strophe-indented-with-italics'>Skin chills. I daydream hibernation. </p>

	<p>The colours of autumn are not rich: <br />
	they are tweeds misted in drizzle, functions <br />
	of an attar-trap rapping my windows, tapping <br />
	my gutters. My pity renounces wars, victims, <br />
	tips reflexive. Turns to self. </p>

	<p class='strophe-indented-with-italics'>Dreams are forfeit. I cannot fight seasons. </p>

	<p>Pity drips like fetid catarrh, drops <br />
	from nostril to tea mug, gets sipped, swilled <br />
	into the maw, swallowed. Drizzle stipples windows <br />
	whittling colours from my view: greying bricks <br />
	in my walls, thoughts in my head. </p>

	<p class='strophe-indented-with-italics'>A hand writes. Monochromes scream.</p>
