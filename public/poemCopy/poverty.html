<div aria-label="Poem body">
	<p>I want to write of iced desolations &ndash;<br />
	my skull-bound voice would rather sing.</p>

	<p>I could pretend the wind outside is shrill &ndash;<br />
	it barely stirs a leaf. What chance have I</p>

	<p>of etching stark horizons when my eyes <br />
	fill with the scrabbles of kids on bikes?</p>

	<p>Such first-world problems I must suffer, stuck<br />
	here in this wealth of health and simple hopes:</p>

	<p>a sturdy roof, refrigeration, heat that burps <br />
	through pipes &ndash; I have a tap that drips</p>

	<p>and cash to pay a man to fix it. Still,<br />
	there's always the internets to steep my gut</p>

	<p>in growly biles, bring acid foams to churn &ndash;<br />
	a proxy grief to make some words spill out.</p>
