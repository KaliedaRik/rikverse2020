<div aria-label="Poem body">
	<p>The bole of the head post has faces<br />
	caught in the vein of the wood, dryads<br />
	set to guard my dreams from harm.</p>

	<p>Slats keep my flesh from sinking<br />
	into forgotten, un-vacuumed carpets<br />
	and the moths who feast on threads.</p>

	<p>I could surround my head with pillows,<br />
	helmet my skull in space-tempered<br />
	foams; one is enough for my neck.</p>

	<p>Sheets knot my limbs to the frame,<br />
	cot me safe as I sail on breath<br />
	to the statics that wash the stars.</p>
