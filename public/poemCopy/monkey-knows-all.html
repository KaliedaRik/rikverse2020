<p aria-label="Epigraph" class="epigraph">(After <span lang="el">Αἰσχύλος</span> and his <span lang="el">ἀπὸ μηχανῆς θεός</span>)</p>

<div aria-label="Poem body">
	<p>Somewhere light-less he shakes a page<br />
	from a periodical, licks the husks<br />
	of bookworms from penny-a-word ads.</p>

	<p>Shelves squeak like storm-drain rats<br />
	as knowledge settles in un-indexed heaps:<br />
	he scavenges their racks for glue.</p>

	<p>He posits an exit from the stacks &ndash;<br />
	he saw it, once, wood-framed with steps<br />
	when he was sniffing for fresh inks.</p>

	<p>He is lost|found, scraping his beard<br />
	with knuckles, its snail-whorl strands<br />
	stitched in place by threads from spines.</p>
