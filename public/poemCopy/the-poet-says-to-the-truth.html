<p aria-label="Epigraph" class="epigraph">(After Federico Garc√≠a Lorca's <a href="https://es.wikisource.org/wiki/El_poeta_dice_la_verdad">El poeta dice la verdad</a>)</p>

<div aria-label="Poem body" data-form="Unrhymed sonnet">
	<p>I want to weep my heart-wrecks: I say this<br />
	so you shall come to love and weep for me<br />
	one night where nightingales call to the air,<br />
	and you and dagger blade and touch and kiss.</p>

	<p>I want to kill the only witness, see,<br />
	who saw the murder, saw my flowers die<br />
	and then I can convert my tears, my sweat<br />
	to an everlasting heap of hard wheat.</p>

	<p>I hope the loose-spooled thread of I love you,<br />
	of you love me &ndash; it never ends: it burns<br />
	along with that old moon, the guttered sun.</p>

	<p>This thing that you won't give, that I don't seek<br />
	from you will be for death, that death which leaves<br />
	no shadow marks across the trembling flesh.</p>
</div>
