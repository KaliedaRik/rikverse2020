	<p>My Gran, she warned me of you:<br />
	"an absence of a man", she said. "A taker<br />
	of breath and life". And here you are<br />
	outlined at my door. <i>Back away</i>,</p>

	<p>I think. <i>Jump!</i> My legs don't shift.<br />
	They lie in sheets, slack meat strung<br />
	on hingeless bones. <i>Wake up</i> &ndash; but I'm not<br />
	asleep. My hands won't lift. I sweat</p>

	<p>as you trespass, my breath lung-tight.<br />
	You come near, a wireframe face skinned<br />
	in shadows. "This death is a bastard",<br />
	Gran told. Your hands touch my chest</p>

	<p>and press down hard, the weight a stroke<br />
	of pain, a stripe of fire along my arm.<br />
	You grin a question: <i>do you want me?</i></p>

	<p class='strophe-indented'><i>Yes</i>, I agree. <i>You I can love</i>.</p>

	<p>You freeze; your lips &ndash; so close &ndash; crack.<br />
	My hand grasps your head as you collapse,<br />
	a slow avalanche of skin and hair. Bone<br />
	arcs across the room, flakes and breaks</p>

	<p>down to the knots of the carpet tufts.<br />
	I heave cold air inside my ribs, consume it.<br />
	Snarl it out. Jabs and stabs grief my arm</p>

	<p>as I turn and clasp my lover tight, claim<br />
	his sweat, his traffic-in-the-distance<br />
	snores.</p>
