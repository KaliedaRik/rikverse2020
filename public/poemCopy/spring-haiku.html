<p>The arch of the branch<br />
drips dew from bud to crocus:<br />
a swallow shivers.</p>

<p>This waterfall roars &ndash;<br />
fish released from icy pools<br />
caught amid the spray.</p>

<p>Mud on the fingers<br />
crumbles to beads as they rub:<br />
seeds mixed in dead skin.</p>

<p>Boots in the high street: dash<br />
and stop and dash on concrete &ndash;<br />
a weed in the crack.</p>

<p>The first bee wanders,<br />
a cold flight through frosty air:<br />
this petal unfurls.</p>
