<div aria-label="Poem body">
	<p>We severed the band together, took a saw<br />
	to its dulled sheen and rasped atoms</p>

	<p>of metal into the air. Soap had failed<br />
	to ease its passage. Later we shopped</p>

	<p>for a larger token. I would not sacrifice<br />
	a single digit of yours to an oval symbol</p>

	<p>of our expanding love.</p>
