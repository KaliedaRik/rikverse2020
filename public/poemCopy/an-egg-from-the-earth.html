<p aria-label="Epigraph" class="epigraph">(After the Sutton Hoo Helm)</p>

<p>You've taken a beating over the years<br />
as the hill above slumped and leached</p>

<p>a skull from your tight caress; your story,<br />
face-stamped, needs no jaw to relate:</p>

<p>here be dragons! Was your Bretwalda<br />
worthy of your coppered plates? He made</p>

<p>you his crown and took you to his ship set<br />
cold above the waves, snug in its clay.</p>

<p>I dare not stare: your sockets demand eyes<br />
fill them, let boars snuffle across brows.</p>
