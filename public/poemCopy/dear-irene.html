<p aria-label="Epigraph" class="epigraph">(After an icon of Irene, possibly from Athens)</p>

<div aria-label="Poem body">
	<p>How sweet of your husband to die<br />
	so soon after stealing your icons.</p>

	<p>You taught generals that the writ<br />
	of a woman has God's esteem,</p>

	<p>that peace is worth the cost of silk;<br />
	God hides in sainted, painted gold.</p>

	<p>Sappho herself mopped your brow<br />
	as you died amid unspun wool. Still,</p>

	<p>the son's eyes had to be widened:<br />
	kiss the cracked gilt frame, and sleep.</p>
