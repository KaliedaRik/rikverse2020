		<p class="level-with-top">How sweet of your husband to die<br />
		so soon after stealing your icons.</p>

		<p>You taught generals that the writ<br />
		of a woman has God's esteem,</p>

		<p>that peace is worth the cost of silk;<br />
		God hides in sainted, painted gold.</p>

		<p>Sappho herself mopped your brow<br />
		as you died amid unspun wool. Still,</p>

		<p>the son's eyes had to be widened:<br />
		kiss the cracked gilt frame, and sleep.</p>
