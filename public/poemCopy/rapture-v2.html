<div aria-label="Poem body">
	<p>One day I woke and the world was stacked<br />
	in a new placenta, a box that cuddled my palm<br />
	like comforts. "I shall be your new friend,"<br />
	it didn't say, for no tool talks platitudes.</p>

	<p>Before I would check for my face in clouds:<br />
	now I have many faces there. Some smile.</p>

	<p>What moves beyond my thumb-summoned truth<br />
	is false news; I switch past ghosts, eat <br />
	amid revenants. Between emojis stir bears <br />
	from cracks.</p>
