	<p>Cold in the ice &ndash; sparkles on needles<br />
	shaken as chips skip from the trunk,<br />
	resin-scent curls moulting: a death<br />
	of seasons. That axe is treasured.<br />
	Old wood slots within the steel that lops<br />
	root from bole, warming the hands<br />
	that swirl it in arcs through air<br />
	as brittle as decorations.</p>

	<p class='strophe-indented'>Good will requires flames, a heap<br />
	of amber tongues licking goose meat<br />
	turned in lines over the stony pit.</p>

	<p>We are in dark places, my love.<br />
	We can sit knee to hip and wait<br />
	beneath our stencilled angels &ndash;<br />
	but he won't come. He has no trust<br />
	in scratch-mark wings or cold hearths.<br />
	Still, I treasure these bricks, know:<br />
	our darkness has warmth, a comfort<br />
	of arms and dry cloth for the wrapping.</p>

	<p class='strophe-indented'>A stew needs more than one bean<br />
	to thicken the broth. We could plant it,<br />
	climb high and sleep in his beard tonight.</p>

	<p>I bought you a present, wrapped<br />
	in scraps as torn as pockets. It is<br />
	&ndash; a bribe, I suppose, a new axe &ndash;<br />
	its shiny shape caught my eyes<br />
	like decorations dangled from boughs.<br />
	You can keep it by the door, if you like,<br />
	or hung on the wall where our fire burned<br />
	before I bricked it away, for safety.</p>
