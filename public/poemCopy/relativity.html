<p class='italic'>(Dedicated to Iain)</p>

<p>Today I am left in bed, my head tethered to a pillow by stout phlegm cords.</p>

<p class='ml-6'>When my friend came back from Paris <br />
he had but two platelets left<br />
to his name. He christened them in memory <br />
of friends: Cabernet and Sauvignon.</p>

<p>Lungs hold their breath, stunned by this vile ague's performance.</p>

<p class='ml-6'>After resisting the pleas of surgeons to scrape <br />
the remains of his spleen from his guts he flew<br />
home to Sydney, rehearsing his Strine slang <br />
on the way to Heathrow.</p>

<p>I hack my appreciation as another cycle of shivers spins to its climax.</p>

<p class='ml-6'>He left us, the proud father of thirty <br />
one brand new baby blood cells,<br />
each one precious,<br />
all home grown.</p>
