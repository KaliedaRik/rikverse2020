<div aria-label="Poem body">
	<p>When the angels came to take the world<br />
	across the universe to heaven,<br />
	I heard a familiar trumpet blown<br />
	&ndash; softly, not quite off-key &ndash;<br />
	as I crouched in my quilted bed alone.</p>

	<p>When the dancers of death recalled the winds<br />
	out from the bellows that blew them,<br />
	I smelt remnants, the faintest taint<br />
	of cheap cologne at the top of the stairs,<br />
	and shook.</p>

	<p>When the sons and daughters of Flamer Jack<br />
	crowded the porch to proclaim the departure<br />
	of one I had tried not to love,<br />
	my eyes burned reflections of their swaying flames<br />
	&ndash; and I cried.</p>

	<p>It was not a father's pulse that failed:<br />
	rather a slice of my Breath. Yet sometimes &ndash;<br />
	when the precious clock strikes, when winter comes,<br />
	when I sense cheap cologne by my side &ndash;<br />
	I know he is there,</p>

	<p>and I learn once more my muscled Breath<br />
	and my Breath that is stopped<br />
	must stay sundered a while longer yet.<br />
	The lesson hurts me: it burns me.<br />
	And still I am scared of the wound.</p>
