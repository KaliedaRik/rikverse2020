<p>Shall I lie to you, today,<br />
as I lied so many times<br />
ago? I am good, I am fine;<br />
the crease on by brow is age,<br />
not rage: an applied beauty &ndash;</p>

<p>and yet I fret. I read memes,<br />
each clause a spell to hope<br />
and wealth &ndash; so many friends<br />
to gather and garnish as I whip<br />
our lives to blessed visions &ndash;</p>

<p>I am not good. There's bones<br />
in my dreams, in my daylit<br />
eyes: each breath is a death<br />
to scheme and plan &ndash; no will or<br />
time: my stage addles in worms.</p>
