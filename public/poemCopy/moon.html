	<p>You share a little secret with me, a monstrous<br />
	gift, padded sweethearts holding hands under a nylon<br />
	moon. You show me inside its front door, where<br />
	you've painted a question mark, then spelt out below:<br />
	with love from Wally. Allowed by your rules, you say.</p>

	<p>Two days before the big dart date you task me to deliver<br />
	the gift, sheathed in its lilac box. Edgeways, the card<br />
	is taller than me: two rubber boots and a bobbly hat<br />
	pushing the wall d'amour against a bucking wind<br />
	to the post office squat centred in Dymchurch<br />
	High Street, in front of the turfed sea wall.</p>

	<p>Inside the office, a duffel-coat queue of old women<br />
	and gossiping men nudge me as I wait for the counter,<br />
	test me: who's the card for, lad? Who's it from? But I <br />
	won't answer, hide the address tighter to my chest. Wish<br />
	I was walking on the moon, like a secret.</p>
