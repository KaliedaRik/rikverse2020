	<p>I married you on a couch in Clerkenwell,<br />
	its stuffing the curls of groin-hair<br />
	that Sebastian had buzz-cut from clients.<br />
	We held hands as he dabbed the needle<br />
	in vodka, pressed its exquisite point<br />
	through the seam of my glans. Not once<br />
	did you glance from my face to watch<br />
	my testicles dance to the pain. We swapped<br />
	our vows in white-hard hand grasps and later<br />
	we kissed, my trousers loose on my waist<br />
	and a dribble of lust on my newest ring.</p>
