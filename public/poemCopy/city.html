<div aria-label="Poem body">
	<p>One Tuesday, I tasted a different city:<br />
	walked along Hackney's canal at the close<br />
	of the day, sat chatting with a friend<br />
	in a canal-side pub. Noticed the green<br />
	between the grey; touched air in place of grime.<br />
	Forgot that this was my home.</p>

	<p>I can see the dome of St Paul's from the office window.<br />
	At dusk, stray sunbursts gild its white walls<br />
	and again the magic happens, transporting me<br />
	to a city I rarely see. Though the moment passes<br />
	and spatters of rain stipple the window,<br />
	I remember the passing pride.</p>
