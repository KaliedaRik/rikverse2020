<p aria-label="Epigraph" class="epigraph">(After Federico Garc√≠a Lorca's <a href="https://es.wikisource.org/wiki/Soneto_de_la_guirnalda_de_rosas">Soneto de la guirnalda de rosas</a>)</p>

<p>Know this: I'm dying! Now! A pretty crown!<br />
You weave it quick for me! And groan &ndash; no! Sing!<br />
For soon fell clouds shall knot tight in my throat<br />
again and beyond count, this new year light.</p>

<p>An uncaught space, your love for me and mine<br />
for you &ndash; a star's shimmer, a leaf's quick twitch;<br />
amid the anemone thickets summon up<br />
a long, dark moan: a year's own length &ndash; entire!</p>

<p>A new landscape freshly drawn from my wound &ndash;<br />
enjoy the snapped reeds, the delicate streams.<br />
Come sip honey and blood set on the thigh.</p>

<p>But soon! Make quick that link to reunite<br />
this love's poor broken mouth, its gnawed-on soul,<br />
else time stalks us for destruction: seared wreath!</p>
