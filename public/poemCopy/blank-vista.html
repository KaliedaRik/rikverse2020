	<p>The day my shadow left I found a scrape<br />
	to hide inside. The hill on which I stood<br />
	had rabbits, sheep. A line of briars caught<br />
	on wool. I sat on tussocks, domes of grass<br />
	as sharp as lies and watched the marsh unfold<br />
	beneath me. Brown it was, and soaked in salts<br />
	from offshore winds, and ploughed. A concrete ear<br />
	slumped near the hill's bald brow hears nothing now;<br />
	it never did: its service soon surpassed<br />
	by better tech. Two gulls above me wheel<br />
	and bicker-scold, wings wide like bombers come<br />
	to rip the world to clods &ndash; as once the marsh<br />
	was muds and spits on which my shadow danced.</p>
