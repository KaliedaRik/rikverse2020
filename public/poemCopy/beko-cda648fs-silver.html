<div aria-label="Poem body">
	<p>My new prize sits in a corner,<br />
	a man-tall coffin of containments<br />
	finished with spun-chrome doors<br />
	that puck-pucker when I tug at<br />
	the gully handles, then sucker back<br />
	to the square when I let go.</p>

	<p>It is a beautiful void, my box,<br />
	a puzzle of diamond shelves<br />
	and drawers hung on white grooves,<br />
	uncluttered invitations<br />
	for the stacking of meats,<br />
	cartoned milk, pickles.</p>

	<p>It hums at me: <i>see, I work<br />
	as you fight grime in wet suds.</i><br />
	It wants me to feed it, let it hug <br />
	the souls of breads and cakes<br />
	in its timeless chill. So easy<br />
	to cling-film memories and pack them</p>

	<p>safe and fresh in its cuddle<br />
	and forget them for a while. "Alan <br />
	would have loved you," I tell it, <br />
	aloud, as I turn back to my stack<br />
	of spattered plates and resume<br />
	the wiping of patterns from clay.</p>
