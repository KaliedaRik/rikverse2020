<div aria-label="Poem body">
	<p>Lips as wide as an atlas moth,<br />
	a nose drawn like hot toffee<br />
	with a new-milled tram line<br />
	to connect the two. A squid<br />
	still wet, perms the crown.<br />
	Bolts for ears triangulate<br />
	a screw of neck into sheet<br />
	flapped shoulders. Who cares<br />
	for details when chemicals<br />
	flood at an eye's command?<br />
	Lust will bewilder us all.</p>
