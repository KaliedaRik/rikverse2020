<p aria-label="narrator">He's tall in his pew, this ladding man:<br />
his eyes are constant, blue beneath<br />
a buzz of hair, soft as the sins<br />
the preacher warns him about. He listens</p>

<p aria-label="narrator">with concentrations of lines embossed<br />
faintly around the edge of lips<br />
wasted on kissing: they want to worship<br />
God &mdash; his God &mdash; with shapes and sounds.</p>

<p aria-label="speaker: preacher" class='strophe-indented-with-italics'><i>"&hellip; this evil works by magic. Look!<br />
It moves by curse to curse and teach<br />
a lesson. God can not be bought<br />
by sinners praying. God will not</i></p>

<p aria-label="speaker: preacher" class='strophe-indented-with-italics'><i>"forgive the hateful sodomites<br />
their lecheries, nor welcome home<br />
the scum who rip the innocents<br />
from wombs. For God will not forgive &hellip;"</i></p>

<p aria-label="narrator">An image of fire curls in the eye<br />
of the lad in his pew, a fire to take<br />
the snoring congregation out<br />
of their comfort, sloth. Redeem their souls</p>

<p aria-label="narrator">like the preacher riding his pulpit now:<br />
a stallion galloping across the hills;<br />
a trawler hauling fish from the storm;<br />
a martyr thanking the Lord for his tortures.</p>

<p aria-label="speaker: preacher" class='strophe-indented-with-italics'><i>"&hellip; that we atone for Adam's sin,<br />
forsake our knowledge, learning; start<br />
afresh, become as pure as steel<br />
and sharp as swords. That we become</i></p>

<p aria-label="speaker: preacher" class='strophe-indented-with-italics'><i>"His instruments to cut away<br />
the cancer &mdash; slice the sins from flesh<br />
to heal the people, strip apart<br />
the souls of Idolators fit</i></p>

<p aria-label="speaker: preacher" class='strophe-indented-with-italics'><i>"to clean them, make them fit for His<br />
inspection. Nothing less will do!<br />
The world is sick and we must make<br />
it better! God will love us then!"</i></p>

<p aria-label="narrator">His fingers grip and bend the book,<br />
his knees are locked: he will not bow<br />
to worship &mdash; God demands he cleanse<br />
his life; he knows the world must burn.</p>
