<div aria-label="Poem body" data-form="Unrhymed sonnet">
	<p>Your voice, it watered dunes within my chest,<br />
	me listening in that sweet wooden stall.<br />
	And south beyond my feet there was a spring<br />
	and north above my brow a flower fern.</p>

	<p>A stretch of slatted light embossed in pine<br />
	to sing beyond a dawn, beyond a seed<br />
	and my tears became flames for the first time &ndash;<br />
	a spray of hopeful wreaths to crown the roof.</p>

	<p>A sweet yet distant voice for me poured out.<br />
	A sweet yet distant voice for me to prize.<br />
	So distant, sweet that voice: so dead and still &ndash;</p>

	<p>a distant voice so like a wounded doe.<br />
	And sweet and yet so like a snowfall sob.<br />
	So distant, sweet, it marrows into me!</p>
