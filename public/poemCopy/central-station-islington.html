	<p>His walk is a stammer of toe pokes and heel scuffs &ndash;<br />
	an eye-stunned debutante at his first gay venue.</p>

	<p>A showboat couple performs at the bar, their attempts<br />
	to eat the other's face blocking paths to alcohol.</p>

	<p>She stands almost demure, her forthright courts black<br />
	on her feet; foundation fails to hide white stubbles.</p>

	<p>The loud ones hang out at the back, pool cue weapons<br />
	slapped over biceps far wider than their twig legs.</p>

	<p>Two &ndash; no, three &ndash; quiet and attentive in their corners.<br />
	They pull smoke from sticks in metronome drags.</p>

	<p>The sightseers gaggle near the stage, boys in tight jeans<br />
	corralled by their keep-the-fuck-away babes.</p>

	<p>There's regulars here too: Pert Pete, Oxblood Andy &ndash;<br />
	Reg the Righteous has made a clean-shirt effort.</p>

	<p>As we enter our hands palm, hot in their fingery tangle;<br />
	we know the flows of this space: we hunt as a team.</p>
