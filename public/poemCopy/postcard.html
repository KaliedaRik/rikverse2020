<p>Molyvos must be  <br />
the essence of Greece. <br />
We're living in a house <br />
on a cobbled street <br />
with steps, but no cars &mdash; <br />
him next door parks <br />
a donkey in his <br />
dry stonewall garage. </p>

<p>We even have a view <br />
of the bay, complete <br />
with picturesque island <br />
and fishermen in old boats <br />
teasing the sea for octopus &mdash; <br />
which then hang in tavernas <br />
to dry on nylon <br />
washing lines, tempting wasps.</p>
