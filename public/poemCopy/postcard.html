	<p>Molyvos must be  <br />
	the essence of Greece. <br />
	We're living in a house <br />
	on a cobbled street <br />
	with steps, but no cars &ndash; <br />
	him next door parks <br />
	a donkey in his <br />
	dry stonewall garage. </p>

	<p>We even have a view <br />
	of the bay, complete <br />
	with picturesque island <br />
	and fishermen in old boats <br />
	teasing the sea for octopus &ndash; <br />
	which then hang in tavernas <br />
	to dry on nylon <br />
	washing lines, tempting wasps.</p>
