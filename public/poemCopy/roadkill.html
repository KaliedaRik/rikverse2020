<p>Car horns on Christmas Eve: a feather slaps the road<br />
as traffic snuffles through the windchilled rain towards<br />
Whitechapel. <i>Fox'll 'ave 'im, see me right</i>. The croak<br />
of nicotine and MaxStrength lager rasps a throat,<br />
coating my face in spittle. I kneel back from jaws &ndash;<br />
a smile of yellow teeth in whiskers, cotton coat<br />
caught up on shoulders thinned to bone. I touch the sores<br />
that screen his face and ask: <i>can angels really fall?</i></p>

<p>Faces can lie, my Mother told me once<br />
and this one's stubble over bliss. It hides<br />
nothing from me: my vendor's eye has scraped<br />
it up for sale in bottles, tinctured grace<br />
priced for a festive gift. A useful find<br />
of angel camouflaged as car-trashed tramp.</p>
