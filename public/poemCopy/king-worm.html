<p>You said: "we can pop them <br />
round the rim, white on red <br />
like stripes, a pole of surfinas <br />
shaved from the wall." I pushed <br />
fingers through humus, broke <br />
knots of the earth between <br />
my strapping palms. One clump <br />
wriggled free of my prayer, <br />
looped as it fell into the bowl<br />
soon to be hoist high above <br />
the world &mdash; a new lord<br />
for the kingdom of heaven.</p>
