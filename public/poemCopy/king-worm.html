	<p>You said: "we can pop them <br />
	round the rim, white on red <br />
	like stripes, a pole of surfinas <br />
	shaved from the wall." I pushed <br />
	fingers through humus, broke <br />
	knots of the earth between <br />
	my strapping palms. One clump <br />
	wriggled free of my prayer, <br />
	looped as it fell into the bowl<br />
	soon to be hoist high above <br />
	the world &ndash; a new lord<br />
	for the kingdom of heaven.</p>
