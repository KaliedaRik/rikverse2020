<div aria-label="Poem body">
	<p>Beyond the dock, a shamble of shacks<br />
	crates a life's worth of stories beneath<br />
	their slow-cooling corrugations. My path<br />
	does not belong here, though my feet<br />
	disagree: I have a question that no measure<br />
	of bourbon will answer. This one</p>

	<p>tells fortunes, she says. Her back<br />
	steeps higher than her head; the sticks<br />
	in her hands speak of richer work<br />
	long lost like a cool morning breeze.<br />
	<i aria-label="speaker: seer">This is not your first turn on the Wheel,<br />
	child. Many times you've climbed,</i></p>

	<p><i aria-label="speaker: seer">slimed, from a woman's womb - and still<br />
	you search."</i> I yearn for a tall tumbler,<br />
	ice promised in alcohol to hold my mind<br />
	to her words: <i aria-label="speaker: narrator">"You know what I seek?"</i><br />
	She murmurs coercions and mentions coin &ndash;<br />
	a dime for bread and insights. Already</p>

	<p>the sun cancers the clouds in blood<br />
	and the nights in these alleys care<br />
	only for drunks. <i aria-label="speaker: narrator">"They say the end<br />
	of time has come,"</i> I tell her. She shakes<br />
	her head against her shrunk chest: <i aria-label="speaker: seer">"True,<br />
	true. None shall be born again, thank God!"</i></p>
