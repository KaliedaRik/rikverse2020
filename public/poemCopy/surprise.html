<div aria-label="Poem body">
	<p>You boxed me back in ninety three,<br />
	a crook-toothed smile slung through dim light <br />
	to hook my eyes, a scatter of limbs<br />
	lanky in their jeans and tee - not my type<br />
	at all and yet, and yet</p>

	<p>here we are, somehow, shook together<br />
	so hard by that life we built I dare not guess<br />
	where you end, I start - a melt of cheese<br />
	over toast, cream and crunch, a gift<br />
	to the world and still, and still.</p>
