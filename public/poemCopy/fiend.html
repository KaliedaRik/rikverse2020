<div aria-label="Poem body">
	<p>Now you have a voice you are a terror<br />
	of demands, and with no lips to form words<br />
	I have no choice but to learn an idiolect<br />
	of slow blinks and shaken tails. This meowl<br />
	is for biscuits, that one for brushing<br />
	and a chirrup to tell me to stop and watch<br />
	as you stretch on the sill, one eye lidded<br />
	as the other waits for entertainments<br />
	from the toys that visit the seed block.</p>
