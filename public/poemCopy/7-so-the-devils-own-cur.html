	<p>So the Devil's own cur must hang, his command chain<br />
	hooked on the gibbet, a tight rope to swell his tongue<br />
	past blushing lips: Kuwait; Karbala; Dujal.</p>

	<p>Old news; cold news; spun from a president's grave<br />
	desire for compassion in evil times: embryos must breathe,<br />
	sodomites repent, a Jesus embossed on each heart.</p>

	<p>On every voter's card, a secret candidate: <i>J'accuse!</i></p>
