<p aria-label="Epigraph" class='epigraph'>Dedicated to Nigel</p>

<p>This is a strange territory: I met it last<br />
when I was small, hand-led in family formation.<br />
Now that I stand tall, the terrain aches its hues.<br />
Horizons are more subtle, the landscapes more distinct.<br />
Deserts mingle with forests; streams flood fields.<br />
Complexities encourage an expedition<br />
I abandoned long ago.</p>

<p>Since you marked my map, I feel surer of my step.<br />
I can avoid the pedestals others have built, track<br />
faint trails through gardens; accept flowers for their colour,<br />
fruit for their taste. Mazes I once hid from, confused, scare me<br />
no more. There is nothing simple in this emotion, nothing pure,<br />
except the map with its crosses, your touch<br />
and my trust.</p>
