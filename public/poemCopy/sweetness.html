	<p>Trauma, know: you're never safe!<br />
	All may seem tranquil - the places<br />
	you move through, the faces<br />
	you animate and yet in spaces<br />
	between moments you feel that trace<br />
	of anxiety stroke your throat;<br />
	an old lover returned to whisper:<br />
	hello! I own all of you, sweetness,<br />
	your marrow, your sprung hair<br />
	across your arm, your shivers<br />
	and sweats as I poke an instant's<br />
	image behind your eyes. Remember<br />
	how I humiliated you in the street?<br />
	Can you still feel my fist? The space<br />
	between us is continental, my face<br />
	loamed in boneyard dirt: still my place<br />
	is here, with you - each thought<br />
	of yours mine, each act of yours<br />
	mine and none can hear you scream<br />
	my sweet for this is ours alone<br />
	and they will never know!</p>
