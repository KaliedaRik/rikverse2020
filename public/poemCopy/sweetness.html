<p>Trauma, know: you're never safe!<br />
All may seem tranquil - the places<br />
you move through, the faces<br />
you animate and yet in spaces<br />
between moments you feel that trace<br />
of anxiety stroke your throat;<br />
an old lover returned to whisper:<br />
hello! I own all of you, sweetness,<br />
your marrow, your sprung hair<br />
across your arm, your shivers<br />
and sweats as I poke an instant's<br />
image behind your eyes. Remember<br />
how I humiliated you in the street?<br />
Can you still feel my fist? The space<br />
between us is continental, my face<br />
loamed in boneyard dirt: still my place<br />
is here, with you - each thought<br />
of yours mine, each act of yours<br />
mine and none can hear you scream<br />
my sweet for this is ours alone<br />
and they will never know!</p>
