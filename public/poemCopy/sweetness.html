	<p>It starts with a touch, a kiss, a sinew stroke<br />
	of recognition by one like you that one is here<br />
	with us and open for &ndash; what? A gift? A lesson? <br />
	A tongue of wet knife amid the lover's tiff?</p>

	<p>Oh sweet summer's child, you cannot deny me!<br />
	That slick of your side eye has summoned me here<br />
	and here I am, keen to knap your flinty jaws<br />
	to elfshot and axes. So how shall we wound?</p>

	<p>Remember the child who stood at assembly, burning<br />
	and cold, while playmates sat leg-knotted and still?</p>

	<p>There was that time you were stood ahead of a tall<br />
	oak desk, a policeman with threats of separations.</p>

	<p>Remember those girls who, seeing how the rattle of bus<br />
	had rearranged your lap to a point, how they laughed?</p>

	<p>That soldier who stood to attention, alone: "My mum<br />
	is a bitch cunt and my dad is her pimp, corporal!"</p>

	<p>Remember the man with the thumb-ring fist? Kids with<br />
	shouts, screwed faces and a rib-pressed gun? Remember</p>

	<p>... I'm here now, my sweetness. I know the shapes<br />
	of the sounds that you want &ndash; need &ndash; to say and<br />
	I say to you: it's okay to gift humiliations<br />
	to those that deserve them and I will forgive<br />
	your trespass as I forgave Cain, and Eve.</p>
