	<p>"Look at the state of you! You're late again<br />
	and dolled up like a dog in heat! I'll bet<br />
	some coins to cars you've been in town to shame<br />
	your name and mine! Beggin' on streets, a threat<br />
	to good and honest folks! Take off that frown<br />
	and come and help! There's rabbits needin' culled<br />
	and chickens plucked and drawn and Missus Brown<br />
	wants lambshanks dressed for Thursday! I'll be pulled<br />
	from bed to bog to get it done in time!<br />
	Just see the state of you! Now put a pan<br />
	of water on the stove and throw some tea<br />
	into yourself &ndash; you're cold, my girl, a crime<br />
	to decent folks, no? You come here to Gran<br />
	and kiss me now! Just see the state of me!"</p>
