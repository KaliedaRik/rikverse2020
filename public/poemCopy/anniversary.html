<p>The shock wears thin<br />
after a while, like skin<br />
punctured once too often.</p>

<p>I have grown a callus<br />
smile, wry and polite<br />
&ndash; almost honest.</p>

<p>Ruby and I check my numbers<br />
like forensic accountants,<br />
a joint task-force:</p>

<p>my flesh-economy saps<br />
are trending higher<br />
for whites this quarter</p>

<p>and I no longer suffer<br />
blue burps after meals,<br />
which is positive news.</p>
