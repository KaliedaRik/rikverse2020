<div aria-label="Poem body">
	<p>Look how quiet the room is: a cat<br />
	whiskers behind sunlit curtains<br />
	for spiders; noses cold rice<br />
	from a plate in search of meat.</p>

	<p>Shadows shoal the tank, each a life<br />
	behind the green scum growing<br />
	on the glass. Tide rings in the mug<br />
	mark the slow sips of a cold coffee.</p>

	<p>You activate me remotely, the song<br />
	of the phone triggering animation,<br />
	audio smiles and shrugs as we chat<br />
	for a while about nothing much at all.</p>
