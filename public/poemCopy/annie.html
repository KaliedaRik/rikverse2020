	<p>Annie sees dragons in all things<br />
	hidden like moths amid fur:<br />
	here in the bricks of her office<br />
	is a wyrm set to watch her flinch<br />
	through doors opened by ghosts.</p>

	<p>She ignores the nip of its breath<br />
	and clips through the marbled foyer,<br />
	lets the lift-drake enfold her<br />
	in glittery wings and huff<br />
	her aloft to her work nook.</p>

	<p>The wyvern at the tea point<br />
	winks as it casts a sear<br />
	of flame over water; she strokes<br />
	the nub of its snout as it drips<br />
	steam through her bitter grinds.</p>

	<p>Associates walk the corridors<br />
	ahead of her, their heels a hiss <br />
	of static on the knots of a great <br />
	blue tongue, each step a whisper &ndash;<br />
	<i>"I taste you; I hunger; I want."</i></p>

	<p>Annie would tell her colleagues<br />
	she sees dragons in all things,<br />
	that the office will eat them<br />
	&hellip; but the scales on their eyes <br />
	are part of the hide, best left.</p>
