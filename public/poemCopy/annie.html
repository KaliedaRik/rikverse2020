<p>Annie sees dragons in all things<br />
hidden like moths amid fur:<br />
here in the bricks of her office<br />
is a wyrm set to watch her flinch<br />
through doors opened by ghosts.</p>

<p>She ignores the nip of its breath<br />
and clips through the marbled foyer,<br />
lets the lift-drake enfold her<br />
in glittery wings and huff<br />
her aloft to her work nook.</p>

<p>The wyvern at the tea point<br />
winks as it casts a sear<br />
of flame over water; she strokes<br />
the nub of its snout as it drips<br />
steam through her bitter grinds.</p>

<p>Associates walk the corridors<br />
ahead of her, their heels a hiss <br />
of static on the knots of a great <br />
blue tongue, each step a whisper &mdash;<br />
<i>"I taste you; I hunger; I want."</i></p>

<p>Annie would tell her colleagues<br />
she sees dragons in all things,<br />
that the office will eat them<br />
&hellip; but the scales on their eyes <br />
are part of the hide, best left.</p>
