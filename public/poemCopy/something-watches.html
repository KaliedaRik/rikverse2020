<p>Something watches. The woods are silent,<br />
no strand of fern disturbed by footfall,<br />
no talon of twig tugged out of place<br />
by the passage of flesh, or fur, or cloth &mdash; <br />
something watches. A whiff of the Marsh <br />
mingles with the mist, mesmers the birds<br />
in the trees to quieten the taps of their quills, <br />
their beaks: something &mdash; stirs the leaf mould: <br />
a finger of mud fruits a knuckle,<br />
a wrist, an elbow, an outline of shoulder <br />
sprouting from the soil; silver moonlight <br />
reflects from the clay as it forms a shape, <br />
a scope of a man. Someone watches &mdash;</p>

<p>a girl in a glade. She gathers the mist<br />
in her palms and sculpts planes and crumples: <br />
the pleat of a skirt; the spin of a ball;<br />
the heel of a shoe that she hangs on her toe<br />
as she sits on a rock that rose to her call.<br />
He watches her brush bracken from her hair, <br />
noting the dirt that dapples her knees,<br />
the length of her arm. When she leans and reaches <br />
her hand to the ground, he hears the gasp<br />
of the bulb as it spindles, blossoms: a snowdrop <br />
for the plucking &mdash; a rare, precious treasure <br />
discovered in the depths of this displaced wood.</p>
