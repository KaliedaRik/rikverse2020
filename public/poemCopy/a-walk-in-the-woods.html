<p aria-label="narrator">This miniature version of man<br />
who has taken my storyline<br />
and spliced it with chapters<br />
from a woman I love takes me<br />
for an adventure.</p>

<p aria-label="speaker: father" class='strophe-indented-with-italics'>We are in danger: there may be<br />
pirates in these woods, or wolves &mdash;<br />
we beat through brambles and scuffle<br />
dry leaves, their poisons mulching<br />
the air we breathe. Toadstools<br />
dust boots with spores, a trail<br />
for bloodhounds to sneeze across<br />
as they hunt the wrongly accused.</p>

<p aria-label="narrator">My foot breaks the ribs<br />
of a squirrel, the space<br />
where its eyes once rested <br />
accusing me; the remains<br />
of its guts dripping grubs<br />
to the ground, seeking escape<br />
from exposure. They piston<br />
their flesh into the earth<br />
eager to straitjacket<br />
their juices, reorder<br />
white flesh into flies.</p>

<p aria-label="narrator">And my lover's eyes <br />
borrowed by my son<br />
watch me grimace, shake <br />
my boot: <span aria-label="speaker: child"><i>"Mum says<br />
you want to be cremated, <br />
like Nana."</i></span> I nod<br />
and smile, wordless.<br />
<span aria-label="speaker: child"><i>"You smile funny,"</i></span> he says,<br />
<span aria-label="speaker: child"><i>"when you step in shit!"</i></span></p>

<p aria-label="narrator">Sometimes I look at you,<br />
my son, stunned by the way<br />
you write your own book;<br />
the way you rewrite mine<br />
without even bothering<br />
to ask.</p>
