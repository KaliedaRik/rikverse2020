	<p aria-label="narrator">This miniature version of man<br />
	who has taken my storyline<br />
	and spliced it with chapters<br />
	from a woman I love takes me<br />
	for an adventure.</p>

	<p aria-label="speaker: child" class='strophe-indented-with-italics'>"We're in deep danger now: there's theives<br />
	in these woods &mdash; pirates even! Or wolves!"</p>

	<p>We beat through brambles and scuffle<br />
	dry leaves, their poisons mulching<br />
	the air we breathe. Toadstools<br />
	dust boots with spores, a trail<br />
	for bloodhounds to sneeze across<br />
	as they hunt the wrongly accused.</p>

	<p aria-label="speaker: child" class='strophe-indented-with-italics'>"Watch out, Dad &mdash; oh, that's real gross!<br />
	If that was a landmine, you'd be dead!"</p>

	<p aria-label="narrator">My foot breaks the ribs of a squirrel, the space<br />
	where its eyes once rested  accusing me. The remains<br />
	of its guts drip grubs to the ground, seeking escape<br />
	from exposure. They piston their flesh into the earth<br />
	eager to straitjacket desperate animations and forge<br />
	their gel juices into the freedoms of flies.</p>

	<p aria-label="narrator">And my lover's eyes borrowed by my son<br />
	watch me grimace, shake offal from my boot:</p>

	<p aria-label="speaker: child" class='strophe-indented-with-italics'>"You smile funny when you step in shit &mdash;<br />
	Mum says you want to be cremated, like Nana;<br />
	did they burn her flowers too? I like roses!"</p>

	<p aria-label="narrator">Sometimes I look at you, summer child, stunned<br />
	by the way you write your own book; the way<br />
	you rewrite mine without even bothering to ask.</p>
