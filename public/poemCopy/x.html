<p>This is the moment, that tick in time when<br />
the bud dies &ndash; raw petals cracking the<br />
straitjacket sepals to pick the tipped lock<br />
that hold the whorl together and ... tock:<br />
the blood rose blooms. A slow instance<br />
of state change, again, again and again<br />
on branch and bush and garden and<br />
&ndash; from one glance to the next &ndash; revolution!</p>

<p>And this moment, the brush of a gale's huff<br />
felling histories to spring a sapling's promise<br />
towards an oak's majesty. And this: a nestling's<br />
plummet stalled by the spread of a wing<br />
to pluck the buff bird from harm and lift it high,<br />
high above us all &hellip; but which to choose?<br />
So many colours in this year's fresh dawn:<br />
so many hues echoed in the healing bruise.</p>
