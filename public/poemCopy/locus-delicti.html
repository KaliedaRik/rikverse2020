<div aria-label="Poem body">
	<p>Would you wear a killer's cardigan?<br />
	It's only wool, see, a weave of sheep<br />
	caught on needles for the looping.</p>

	<p>And that ring, a sweetheart's gift,<br />
	has no magic; the stones glint<br />
	metaphors &ndash; a garnet's love.</p>

	<p>Those locks of your hair I curl<br />
	in my wallet? A keepsake, no more:<br />
	a clipped crime for a stolen moment.</p>
