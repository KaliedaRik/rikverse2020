<p>So when did we begin to evolve<br />
a different tongue? That first night<br />
of friction, perhaps, our growls<br />
new sounds for acts and thoughts;<br />
or weeks later, meeting in pubs,<br />
shifting lexemes to build a space<br />
between us and the crowds<br />
who admired our mutual lusts?</p>

<p>Or did we develop our idiolect<br />
browsing shops for sofas and linens,<br />
partners in style crimes? I speak you<br />
as well as you talk me, and sometimes<br />
we'll even chat silently, conversations<br />
conveyed by touch, look. Observe how<br />
my shoulders type: <i>'I love you!'</i></p>
