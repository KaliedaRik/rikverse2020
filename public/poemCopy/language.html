<div aria-label="Poem body">
	<p>So when did we begin to evolve<br />
	a different tongue? That first night<br />
	of friction, perhaps, our growls<br />
	new sounds for acts and thoughts;<br />
	or weeks later, meeting in pubs,<br />
	shifting lexemes to build a space<br />
	between us and the crowds<br />
	who admired our mutual lusts?</p>

	<p>Or did we develop our idiolect<br />
	browsing shops for sofas and linens,<br />
	partners in style crimes? I speak you<br />
	as well as you talk me, and sometimes<br />
	we'll even chat silently, conversations<br />
	conveyed by touch, look. Observe how<br />
	my shoulders type: <i>'I love you!'</i></p>
