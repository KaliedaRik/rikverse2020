<div aria-label="Poem body">
	<p>"She's messed me up, again: my shiny blade<br />
	a tarnished map of haemoglobins. Look<br />
	at how she spoilt my spine, my bolster glued<br />
	with fingerprints! She's crying now, as if<br />
	the cuts are my responsibility &ndash;<br />
	like I should care; she hasn't sharpened me<br />
	in days, not since she last kissed me, my scales<br />
	and tang held fast between her breasts. I know<br />
	she can't love me &ndash; I'm just the tool. But still<br />
	there must be something there, a hint of care<br />
	in choosing me repeatedly to mark<br />
	her skin with messages, her runes of loss<br />
	and hurt and farewell notes, the secret pains<br />
	she takes to wrap me safe in swaddling cloth."</p>
