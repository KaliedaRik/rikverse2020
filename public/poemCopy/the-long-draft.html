   Did you hear
        how they built
            a chimney
            that reached up
                to prick the shawl
            of the sky, high
            like the flight
        of rockets, geese
        and heroes.
    They wanted
    to shout at
    God, you see,
        make sure He
            heard their praise.
            On each brick,
        a signature
            penned by a
            penitent
            keen to book
            a cushion stool
                of thunderclouds
                    to witness
                    the world's end.
                        That chimney rose
                    so high the stars
                    themselves dodged
                    the hum of songs
                        birthed, evolved
                        and dead within
                            its long throat.
                            Many roasted
                        on the hearth,
                    their oiled smoke
                    caught on the flue.
                Did I buy
                a brick? Yes,
            an orange one,
            as flaked as
            the ones that held
        my grandmother
    beneath her roof;
    But I didn't like
        the pointing, and
        their choice of mortar
              was shoddy.
