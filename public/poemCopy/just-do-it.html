<p>It's like that moment when<br />
someone, burning the map,<br />
shouts: let's follow that starling!<br />
Like when Mum tosses baby<br />
into the air and bellows: catch!<br />
It’s as if Charlie, finding gold <br />
in his chocolate, eats the ticket;<br />
or you turn to me with eyes</p>

<p>cool and warm and half-lashed<br />
and say: let's move in together &mdash;<br />
and we leap elsewhere, each day<br />
another jump, mapless, flying<br />
free of care or promise of candy,<br />
daring the world to deliver.</p>
