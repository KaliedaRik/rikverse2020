<div aria-label="Poem body">
	<p>It's like that moment when<br />
	someone, burning the map,<br />
	shouts: let's follow that starling!<br />
	Like when Mum tosses baby<br />
	into the air and bellows: catch!<br />
	Itâ€™s as if Charlie, finding gold <br />
	in his chocolate, eats the ticket;<br />
	or you turn to me with eyes</p>

	<p>cool and warm and half-lashed<br />
	and say: let's move in together &ndash;<br />
	and we leap elsewhere, each day<br />
	another jump, mapless, flying<br />
	free of care or promise of candy,<br />
	daring the world to deliver.</p>
