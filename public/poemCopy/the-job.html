<p>Nine strikes chime the length of the hall.<br />
She steeples her ears, extends a length<br />
of claw and, in good time, yawns &ndash; the reach<br />
of jaw wide and sharp and languid. A slit of jade<br />
checks for scurries in shadows; a slow swish<br />
in the webs that cove the room's ceiling<br />
speaks of open windows. She levers limbs<br />
from the curl and, four paws to the point,<br />
arches, tail tall: shiver; still. The fluff<br />
of dreams flicks from her lobes, and a lick<br />
of spit primes whiskers for work. All edges<br />
in her domain shall be checked, all scents<br />
renewed by cheek and chin and scratch &ndash;<br />
this duty never ends &hellip; until the next nap.</p>
