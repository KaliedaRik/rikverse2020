	<p>I suppose a pen and a scrap of envelope<br />
	will do, for scribbles that hit mid-amble <br />
	along the street, or on a bus. And a keyboard <br />
	can take a good pounding of angst, or a tap-peck<br />
	for a milder bout of the muse.</p>

	<p>But nursery scripts demand to be spelt<br />
	on alphabet bricks across the carpet. <br />
	Competitive strophes must be gridded <br />
	with Scrabble tiles, rhyme sacrificed <br />
	for the triple word score.</p>

	<p>And the joys of play dough snakes pressed<br />
	into sentences across the dinner table<br />
	(or the workstation when the boss is away),<br />
	verse upon verse coursing across the surface,<br />
	punctuated with multicolour dinosaur stops.</p>

	<p>Historical epics demand quill and parchment:<br />
	the local college offers courses in do-it-yourself<br />
	writing kits, supply your own pigeon wings <br />
	and kitten skins. Epigrams are built for clay <br />
	tablets, baked in the oven alongside the pot roast.</p>

	<p>If an image hits as I walk along the shoreline<br />
	then a stick and sand will do, big poems<br />
	decorated with seaweed and conch shells<br />
	to be seen by seagulls until the tides of time<br />
	scrub my visions back into the beach. </p>

	<p>Or for that one-time invitation only performance<br />
	piece, a neighbour's wallpapered lounge and a set <br />
	of day-glo crayons: it's art, I cry, as policemen smash<br />
	through windows, unbind the audience, muscle<br />
	me out of the house.</p>

	<p>And then those special times, late at night,<br />
	when I creep to the kitchen and settle in<br />
	for a feast, and indulge in my secret vice:<br />
	chocolate, vodka, and magnetic fridge poetry.<br />
	Drafting while the rest of my world snores.</p>
