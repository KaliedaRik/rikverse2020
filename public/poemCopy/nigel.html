<div aria-label="Poem body">
	<p>You snatched me back in ninety three,<br />
	a crook-toothed smile spun through dim light<br />
	to hook my eyes, a scatter of laughs and limbs<br />
	lanky in jeans and tee &ndash; not my type<br />
	at all and yet, and yet</p>

	<p>here we are, somehow, boxed together<br />
	so hard by that life we built I dare not guess<br />
	where you end, I start &ndash; a melt of cheese<br />
	over toast, cream and crunch, a shrine<br />
	to sated lusts and still, and still &ndash;</p>
