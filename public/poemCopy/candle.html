<div aria-label="Poem body">
	<p>In an island of hard-polished desk<br />
	squats the stump of a candle, wax spat<br />
	on the green, chipped dish. Once<br />
	it was tall, hard: a column of opportunity.<br />
	The flame has stroked too often, the bright wick<br />
	is aged too soon. The sun is guttering<br />
	and my windows are smeared.</p>

	<p>There is no clock on my wall<br />
	to tick me to grey. I am sat before a mirror<br />
	to watch my face fade to patterns<br />
	in reflected walls. When the sun surrenders,<br />
	I am gone: un-mirrored, I cannot be.</p>

	<p>Somebody stole the moon, leaving half<br />
	a milky mug-stain where once the silver tureen<br />
	overflowed. Now that I am not human, I can smile, creasing<br />
	what was once a face. I do not know<br />
	who stole the moon, but they stole my clock<br />
	and my candle too.</p>
