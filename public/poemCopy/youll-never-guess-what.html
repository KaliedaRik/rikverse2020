	<p>I watch his mouth, let the slip of his lips <br />
	and the sounds of his words slide slowly <br />
	out of sync. These phrases must be important: <br />
	the way he tubes his cheeks round <i>'boot'</i> <br />
	and <i>'threw'</i> suggests I should share in his shock. <br />
	"She never," I offer, keen to see if the drawl <br />
	of his vowels can twang the tether of slaver <br />
	caught at the edge of his gob. The spit <br />
	of <i>'she'll never change'</i> spats in my eyes. Still <br />
	the story spills past the paired, pink leeches <br />
	nestled within his stubbled skin &ndash; some chant <br />
	of names, some known to me. The bloodworms <br />
	stretch thin; slacken to plump comforts; part <br />
	for a moment as his tongue glides forwards <br />
	to lick them to a shine. When his teeth nova <br />
	I, too, laugh at what I hope is the joke.</p>
