<p>She plucks history from the soil &mdash;<br />
a poison-blue bottle here, a clipped<br />
coin for which a man was hanged. Each gives<br />
her fingers a fuzz of images, a chain<br />
daisying back from disposal to creation.</p>

<p>She does not touch people: the immediacy<br />
of their sweat hurts her temples. Instead<br />
she collects their detritus to review<br />
their stories; keeps a library<br />
of her favourite episodes in her pocket.</p>
