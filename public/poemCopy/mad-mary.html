	<p>She plucks history from the soil &ndash;<br />
	a poison-blue bottle here, a clipped<br />
	coin for which a man was hanged. Each gives<br />
	her fingers a fuzz of images, a chain<br />
	daisying back from disposal to creation.</p>

	<p>She does not touch people: the immediacy<br />
	of their sweat hurts her temples. Instead<br />
	she collects their detritus to review<br />
	their stories; keeps a library<br />
	of her favourite episodes in her pocket.</p>
