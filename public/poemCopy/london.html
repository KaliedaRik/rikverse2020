<p>Should he ever speak of home,<br />
it would be of the land he would tell:<br />
villages on sea level plains would again build<br />
in the midst of his eye.<br />
He would trek in sentences, friends he has known &ndash;<br />
paths trod as a child in hand-me-down shoes.<br />
The music. The radios. The open grate fire. <br />
The gossip of neighbours<br />
who visited for news.</p>

<p>Of home he will not speak: not to me.<br />
He will drink the juice of his home<br />
in this mock ale house. He will smoke.<br />
He will listen to records, captured rhythm,<br />
smile, talk of work and weather<br />
to spartan associates: he will not gossip.<br />
The gossip bears no depth for him.<br />
We are alien twins glance-met in London,<br />
and the mirror before me<br />
is smudged.</p>
