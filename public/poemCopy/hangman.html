<p>I'm hunting you down &mdash; drafting a list<br />
of events and evaluating you<br />
in my memory of them. To verify<br />
my truths I turn to independent proofs.<br />
Super eight cine film was the craze<br />
when I was six. You filmed everything:<br />
edited and spliced. Directed. Topped<br />
and tailed the evidence with credits. Dates.<br />
I squirm as I watch again my fat legs trot<br />
through the safari park. Here, we are a family.<br />
Mum smiles, I giggle. You laugh. We feed<br />
ostriches with sandwiches, dodge their preening beaks.<br />
We watch elephants bathe, wallabies graze,<br />
peacocks display. We tame each other.</p>

<p>As a finale you film me pissing<br />
on the trunk of a sycamore tree<br />
in Windsor Great Park. In the film I watch,<br />
your thumb is shadowed in the lens,<br />
hiding my naked quarters. Perhaps that<br />
was planned. Perhaps I remember you<br />
wrong.</p>
