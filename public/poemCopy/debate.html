	<p>So I sit myself on a step to wait for buses.</p>

	<p>We need to talk politics, says my voice,<br />
	or at least metaphors. Who has<br />
	the best of our trust today? </p>

	<p>Trust is a tall order: I've seen them smile.</p>

	<p>We could go shopping, check out<br />
	the manifestos and thieve ideas<br />
	for our brave new ideology ...</p>

	<p>My cheeks pucker at such tart treats.</p>

	<p>See the parlour on whose step<br />
	we loiter? How about a new tattoo<br />
	to flag loyalty to our old tribe?</p>

	<p>My skin is mark free; still I see inks.</p>

	<p>Wait to see who knocks first<br />
	on our door, then. I bet they come<br />
	in threes, like these buses.</p>

	<p>So much of so little to choose from.</p>

	<p>I elect a route home. The bus<br />
	with most free seats <br />
	wins.</p>
