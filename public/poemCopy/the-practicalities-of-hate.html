	<p>It has been eight days since the fact<br />
	of the ballot came to bristle in the bricks<br />
	of our homes; still we disbelieve. Which<br />
	neighbour cheered this act? Which sibling?</p>

	<p>Those tenets we told each other? They are<br />
	lies. We are not modern; not progressive. We<br />
	are base; we are dirty. We hate, just as those<br />
	who chose different seem to us like loathers<br />
	of worlds beyond our shores. Such a heady new<br />
	feeling! It takes our thoughts, our throats, feeds<br />
	us a gut-brewed bile so we can poison words &ndash;</p>

	<p>lazy, witless, unthinking hogs happy to vote<br />
	as the headlines command them, keen to cast<br />
	that first flint at each new day's enemy &hellip;<br />
	this is my future too? Tatters of the dream<br />
	that was once my England flap in the gutter;<br />
	I will not wait for a new summer storm to wash<br />
	the streets clean: I have a brick in my hand.</p>
