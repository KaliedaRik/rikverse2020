<div aria-label="Poem body">
	<p>Winter spit taps on my skull:<br />
	cold drops print <i>'you don't belong<br />
	out here'</i> on the paving slabs.</p>

	<p>These shoes I borrowed pinch<br />
	my toes and your coat's too thin<br />
	to keep the wind at bay. Still,</p>

	<p>this morning's kiss still warms<br />
	my lips. I puff smoke between the rain<br />
	and respond: <i>'you don't belong in me.'</i></p>
