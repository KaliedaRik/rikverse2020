<p>Winter spit taps on my skull:<br />
cold drops print <i>'you don't belong<br />
out here'</i> on the paving slabs.</p>

<p>These shoes I borrowed pinch<br />
my toes and your coat's too thin<br />
to keep the wind at bay. Still,</p>

<p>this morning's kiss still warms<br />
my lips. I puff smoke between the rain<br />
and respond: <i>'you don't belong in me.'</i></p>
