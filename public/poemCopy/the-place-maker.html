<p>I met Mother Drum when she came for beer,<br />
her hair in a net and her tongue in gear:</p>

<p>she believed the mayor took backhanded cash<br />
and offered his friends good contracts for trash;</p>

<p>she knew that the sewers were stuffed with snakes<br />
which fed on pet cats and poisoned the lakes;</p>

<p>she witnessed the vicar steeped in sin<br />
teaching the alter-boys how to drink gin;</p>

<p>she heard that the doctor killed on demand<br />
and sold newborn kids for ten thousand pounds;</p>

<p>she once found a needle stuck in a bun<br />
bought from the grocer who had a bent son;</p>

<p>her son was a waste of time and good space &ndash;<br />
one day he'd kill her, inherit her place.</p>
