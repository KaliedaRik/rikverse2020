	<p>They say it takes a thief to catch a diamond:<br />
	the stone I seek should spark like resurrections &ndash;<br />
	but not in this city of parvenu panhandlers, too busy<br />
	skimming the cream of solid work to sniff the sewer<br />
	they sit in. A long walk later I find my thief</p>

	<p>stood in a tap room with ant-addled stools:<br />
	"Can't abide the scrub of them splinters on my arse,<br />
	if you can savvy me." I oil him in gin to part his lips:<br />
	"You know where he is?" He has a slow, long smile<br />
	and a longer nod &ndash; "I sees him around. He peeps</p>

	<p>through them holes in his hands, that one,<br />
	not keen to hold to his promises. But I knows<br />
	him well, his smells and shakes. I shares<br />
	his fame like we shared that hill for a time &ndash;<br />
	he's quiet, mind: worries his head for our world;<br />
	he won't scream no more for this dead making."</p>
