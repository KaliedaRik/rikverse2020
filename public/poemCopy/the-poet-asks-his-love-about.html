<p aria-label="Epigraph" class="epigraph">(After Federico García Lorca's <a href="https://es.wikisource.org/wiki/El_poeta_pregunta_a_su_amor_por_la_%C2%ABCiudad_Encantada%C2%BB_de_Cuenca">El poeta pregunta a su amor por la «Ciudad Encantada» de Cuenca</a>)</p>

<p>You liked the city that by drop on drop<br />
the water carved amid the round of pines?<br />
You saw, did you, the dreams and faces, roads<br />
and walls, those walls of pain the air there whips?</p>

<p>And you saw the blue crack, the broken moon<br />
the Júcar soaks in crystals and their trills?<br />
Your fingers, did their tips then kiss the thorns<br />
that weave in love to crown the distant stone?</p>

<p>Did you remember me as you then climbed<br />
towards those silent jags of rock and snakes,<br />
a prisoner of crickets and soft shades?</p>

<p>Did you not spot beyond the clean, clear air<br />
a dahlia of heartbreaks stitched with joy<br />
that my hot heart commanded up to you?</p>
