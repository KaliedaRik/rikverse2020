<p>When I cough too long<br />
I see rainbow bubbles &ndash;<br />
flying carpets for fairies<br />
who have lost their wings</p>

<p>to age. When I cough<br />
your words fall apart,<br />
a jumble of elvish spells<br />
shivering the air to</p>

<p>jack at my ears. When<br />
I cough and cough walls<br />
shudder and trees march;<br />
my troll foot slips on carpet</p>

<p>and pixies swirl my belly &hellip;<br />
such magic I see in the world <br />
around, such a knot of insights<br />
as I beg my lungs to inspire.</p>
