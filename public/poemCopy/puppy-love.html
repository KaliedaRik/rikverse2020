<p>When I heard that song on the radio<br />
I became a silver jubilee younger. You<br />
look good in my head, the shaving cuts<br />
barely crevassing your sheen of cheek.</p>

<p>Lavender was your smell, as soft<br />
on my nose as your clothes against<br />
my hands when by chance I stroked you:<br />
I still want to peel you of them.</p>

<p>We drifted &ndash; my lust got hidden in<br />
text books, equations, exams. You<br />
were too tidy in the end, I was scared<br />
and the song was derivative, cheap.</p>
