<p>As the hovercraft puffed its skirts <br />
against the concrete apron, so I flew &ndash;<br />
Dover harbour a spray of images<br />
behind my brother as he swung me<br />
over the salt-crust lawns, the edge<br />
of the unguarded cliff, a hand-grasp away<br />
from learning the dangers of trust.</p>

<p>Now the last hovercraft has been scrapped<br />
for spares, I can discover new seductions:<br />
the dangers of windy walks through stiff grasses<br />
to watch the sea bolster Dover below; the feel<br />
of rain spattering my neck, my back<br />
as I dance with you, tonight's friend,<br />
on the edge of the cliff &ndash; eyes forward <br />
not down &ndash; each step an experiment<br />
in my trust of flinty contact.</p>
