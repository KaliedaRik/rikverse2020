	<p>She lines them up in rows,<br />
	pretends to be a teacher.</p>

	<p>Today she'll teach her friends<br />
	about the world of adults &ndash;</p>

	<p>the need to shout and cry<br />
	and writhe and snort in bedrooms.</p>

	<p>Her friends look on and nod,<br />
	agreeing. One has dust mites;</p>

	<p>another's eye droops down<br />
	un-threaded from its socket.</p>

	<p>One asks: does Lucy play<br />
	these games? <i>'Oh, no,'</i> she whispers.</p>

	<p>She much prefers to let<br />
	her fingers make her happy,</p>

	<p>but only when she's safe<br />
	and hid beneath her table.</p>
