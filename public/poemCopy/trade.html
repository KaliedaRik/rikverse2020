<p>You grab my hand and net aside<br />
the camouflage and walk into the murk:<br />
there's ghosts in here &ndash; they moan<br />
in whispers, grunts; the shunts<br />
and smacks of fruitless, faceless<br />
love; anonymous entanglements<br />
of slugging tongues. I slip<br />
my hands around your waist,<br />
then down into your jeans to cup<br />
your muscled arse, pull our groins<br />
together. Can you see the devil<br />
set within my eyes? I can suck<br />
the wisdom teeth from jaws,<br />
the snot from lungs; I<br />
can gnaw through sweat-built chests<br />
to lick the hearts of warriors,<br />
my fifteen minute friend who asked<br />
to dance astride some tumid tail.</p>
