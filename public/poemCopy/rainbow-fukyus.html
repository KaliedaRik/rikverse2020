<p><b>Red</b> for the surge of<br />
heat in my cheeks the first time<br />
I caught your steel eye</p>

<p><b>Orange</b> for the rugs<br />
we scrabbled across as we<br />
wrestled to climax</p>

<p><b>Yellow</b> for the clots<br />
of custard we used to sign<br />
promises on chests</p>

<p><b>Green</b> for the garden<br />
we stood in as we shared vows &ndash;<br />
illegal contracts</p>

<p><b>Blue</b> for the water<br />
that almost drowned us, ripped us<br />
and flipped us aside</p>

<p><b>Indigo</b> for the<br />
flowers we placed on friends' graves,<br />
each pistil a void</p>

<p><b>Violet</b> for the<br />
sky we stand beneath, our hands<br />
still glued together</p>
