<div aria-label="Poem body">
	<p>From tilled earths grow strange plants,<br />
	a new-season show of tempered stems<br />
	bursting in circles amid April's rain.</p>

	<p>One is a milliner's inspiration &ndash;<br />
	a race-day fantasy for Ascot ladies.</p>

	<p>Another throws an ovation of arches<br />
	over concrete ponds. A storm stream<br />
	born in a mountain maker's track<br />
	hosts spawn scattered by lost frogs.</p>

	<p>Each overcast morning brings a clutch<br />
	of fresh, tax-manured buds in this farm<br />
	for the cropping of precious metals<br />
	&ndash; bronze, and silver, and gold.</p>
