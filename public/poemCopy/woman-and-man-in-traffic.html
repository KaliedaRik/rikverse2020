<p>Meanwhile let's talk<br />
of mittens: their uses<br />
are manifold,</p>

<p>cold oppressors knitting<br />
their threads into nets<br />
to catch new fingers &mdash;<br />
hand-wombs.</p>

<p>Watch them reach out,<br />
grasp at a gust, tuck it<br />
in a mouth &mdash; stitches<br />
easing gums.</p>

<p>Look past the window<br />
to the road: a mitten,<br />
lost in speed.</p>
