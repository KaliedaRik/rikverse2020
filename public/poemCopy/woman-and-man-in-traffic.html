	<p>Meanwhile let's talk<br />
	of new mittens: their uses<br />
	are manifold,</p>

	<p>coldness suppressors knitting<br />
	their threads into nets<br />
	to catch fresh fingers &ndash;<br />
	hand-wombs.</p>

	<p>Watch them reach out,<br />
	grasp at a gust, tuck it<br />
	in a mouth &ndash; stitches<br />
	easing gums.</p>

	<p>Look past the window<br />
	to the road: a mitten,<br />
	lost in speed.</p>
