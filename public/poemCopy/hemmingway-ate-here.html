	<p>He starts to build the fire before the sun<br />
	sneaks out of the country. Two great beams<br />
	liberated from the railway track form the base<br />
	on which to balance the oil drum. Boys<br />
	from the school down the street watch him<br />
	break sticks for kindling, run when the aunts<br />
	take to pasting magazine strips onto strings<br />
	to weave between the balconies.</p>

	<p class='strophe-indented-with-italics'>The weather continues<br />
	hot and humid. No<br />
	hurricanes today.<br />
	Wishing you were here<br />
	in place of me. Beggars<br />
	and hustlers drain<br />
	all fun from this place.</p>

	<p>The new-wrought iron edging my balcony<br />
	is a border post: behind me, a tourist<br />
	destination, where food is delivered<br />
	with a surly smile and guides take us<br />
	in coaches to beaches. I have a maid.<br />
	Men with gold teeth would sell me<br />
	a woman &ndash; or a boy &ndash; as long my pockets<br />
	rustle with convertible pesos, enough<br />
	for them to bribe the officer with the gun.</p>

	<p>Downstairs is a different Havana; one<br />
	the authorities have not yet fixed up<br />
	for my eyes. I smile at the fat woman<br />
	when she waves to me; she has not moved<br />
	from her couch for a week, her teeth<br />
	almost as rotten as the panels of her door.</p>

	<p class='strophe-indented-with-italics'>Today we went<br />
	to a beach where<br />
	nobody tried<br />
	to sell us cigars<br />
	or sex. Men<br />
	with peak caps<br />
	and guns patrolled<br />
	the sands. I miss<br />
	the sound of motorways.</p>

	<p>The smell of roasting goat miracles<br />
	the fat woman from her couch, to lean<br />
	her heavy arms on her rust-woven<br />
	balustrade. You ask: <i>"are you hungry?"</i><br />
	I nod my head in time with the salsa.<br />
	<i>"We can eat at the Bodeguita, and take<br />
	a pen to sign the walls."</i> I smile<br />
	and agree, though I know they whitewash<br />
	the restaurant annually. They serve goat<br />
	there too, which makes a change<br />
	from chicken, or pork, or fish.</p>
