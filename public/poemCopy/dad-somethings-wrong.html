	<p>"Son, you know it takes some time to see<br />
	the truth from fiction: Tom don't die for real<br />
	and Jerry's just a cartoon mouse. He feels<br />
	no pain when caught beneath a knife. But we<br />
	are real: you bleed when a door traps your thumb<br />
	and bumps don't disappear when tea trays smack<br />
	your head (and I apologise for that &ndash;<br />
	an accident I swear!) So please, my son,<br />
	re-latch the safety, lower the gun and tell<br />
	me what your Nan has done to make you mad<br />
	like Butch who's lost his bone? And why<br />
	insist on silver slugs? I know Nan smells<br />
	a bit like dogs, and yes she howls. It's sad!<br />
	But she's your Nan, and you are part of our tribe."</p>
