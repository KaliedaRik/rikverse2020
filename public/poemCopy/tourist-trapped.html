  <p>Another hot day in Havana. This morning I remember to put on a clean pair of underpants before opening the room’s warped, wooden shutters.</p>

  <p>"She’s still there."</p>

  <p>"Who?" asks Nigel. He’s in the midst of his morning routine, currently working on his teeth in the small apartment’s newly restored bathroom.</p>

  <p>"Our lady of leisure."</p>

  <p>I wave to the woman in the apartment opposite. After five days I’ve come to know every detail of her room: the matte paint on the walls that peels from the plaster in peach curls; the massive, fabric shade of her light &ndash; a tattered velvet of blotched reds and browns &ndash; now swaying erratically as a gecko clambers onto it from the ceiling. It’s a safe haven, I reckon; I’ve never seen her use the light: she has a huge, catholic candle to keep her company in the evenings.</p>

  <p>She waves back to me, her big, half-tooth smile as decrepit as much of this city, though far more genuine. She’s the only local I’ve met here who has no interest in selling me cigars, or charlie, or a girl for an hour.</p>

  <p>Gargles and chokes alert me to my lover’s bathroom extravaganza finale.</p>

  <p>"You know, I’ve not seen her leave that chair since we got here?"</p>

  <p>"Maybe she and her chair are one," says Nigel. "They’re as stuffed as each other. They even wear the same material."</p>

  <p>"She’s a big woman," I agree. "I wonder if she understands what we’re saying?"</p>

  <p>"You think she can hear us?"</p>

  <p>"Somebody’s switched off her radio."</p>

  <p>"Or there’s another power cut. Wave goodbye to her and close the shutters: I want to get dressed."</p>

  <p>I ignore him. To do as he asks would derail the next part of his routine; I need to indulge in a few acts of indifference to make sure he has enough material for our morning bicker, like Laurel feeding Hardy some choice lines to set up the slap down. </p>

  <p>The street separating us from our unmoving neighbour is narrow: washing lines criss-cross between buildings for much of its straight, cobbled length, some still decked in patriotically painted strips of old newspaper &ndash; a reminder of Fidel’s 80th birthday celebrations a few weeks before. Looking to the left I can see the corner of the old cathedral, half-wrapped in a skeleton of refurbisher’s scaffold. Five days into the holiday, and already I’ve decided that the city is dangerously schizophrenic, some streets and squares fitted out in a fetish of tourist finery while around the corner buildings threaten to collapse under their weight of rotting frames and mouldy plasters.</p>

  <p>"What’s that racket?"</p>

  <p>"They must be teaching the kids a patriotic song," I say. The school lies (or, more correctly, slumps) at the other end of our street, three stories of shrills and screams that seem to be beyond the control of the adults &ndash; even the ones who wear their pistols and sub-machine guns on the outside of their cotton-thin uniforms.</p>

  <p>"They woke me up at seven o’clock, the little buggers!"</p>

  <p>"Maybe tomorrow morning they’ll scream in key," I say. "Can you put some clothes on, please? I’m hungry!"</p>

  <hr />

  <p>Since the moment the plane ejected us onto the airport’s tarmac I’ve been busy developing a new obsession. Food occupies my thoughts from rude-woken morning to heat-sapped evening. If I close my eyes I can see heaps of meat, some charred, sat amid platters of roasted roots and fresh-culled salads. Sometimes my visions come with added aromas: the tang of chilli and the itch of pepper to go alongside the balm mint they crush into the day-trippers’ mojitos.</p>

  <p>We ease ourselves into chairs overlooking the old cathedral’s square and order the restaurant’s overpriced ‘Cuban’ club sandwich. The ham is as processed as the cheese, and was probably rendered in the same factory where the chicken met its end. At least the bread offers a different, more organic experience for the tongue. And yet this is a feast to me, containing three of the four Cuban staples &ndash; I’ve avoided the fourth, seafood, since our walk along the lagoon harbour that sits behind the city and the sea. I add my own salt and pepper to the layers before I bite into them.</p>

  <p>Nigel asks for tea; I settle for cola. We bicker for a few minutes over who is being the worse imperialist, but already it’s too hot to get the maximum enjoyment out of the effort.</p>

  <p>"How do you reckon they boil the water?" I ask.</p>

  <p>"They probably use a saucepan on the stove."</p>

  <p>"We ought to check the kitchen. Maybe the customs man sold our kettle to them."</p>

  <p>The memory of our first encounter with Cuban officialdom is enough to make us both grimace. There’s a kettle crisis in Cuba, a drought of kettles, a profitable black market in kettles brought into the country by unsuspecting visitors. Though to be fair the man had let us smuggle our teabags into the country, which was just as well as it gave the hotel staff something to liberate. Cuba is nothing if not an equal opportunities nation.</p>

  <p>We settle and wait, agreeing a desultory bet between us on whether our brunch would be served before the sun edges the building’s shade away from our table. Today the restaurant, and the re-pointed square it overlooks, is quiet &ndash; the first time we’ve been able to watch the local entertainers at rest. The bulk of people, our tour rep had told us, choose only to spend a couple of days in Havana; a welcome break away from their all-inclusive beaches. Most of the remainder dock for a few hours in the port: enough time to catch a bus tour around the key locations followed by some casual shopping along the old quarter’s single street of well-stocked shops, where the smiling policemen with their shiny sub-machine guns keep their sister-selling neighbours away from the tourist crops.</p>

  <p>The square’s resident salsa band sits in a huddle around a box in the far corner, where the shade looks deep and cool. Freed from the need to play Guantanamera to the passing trade they quietly improvise, snaking percussive rhythms between the even chords of guitars and voices. "Is called son," the waiter tells us when we ask him. "Old music from the plantations &ndash; and a little jazz, I think, to make it interesting. I shall call them here so you can listen better, yes?"</p>

  <p>"No," we both say in unison. "Thank you, no." The waiter wrinkles his eyes into a smile, pats Nigel on the shoulder and returns to the comforts of his shaded stool on the verandah; he is our friend and already knows we have no taste for charlie, or girls by the hour.</p>

  <p>"Have you decided what you want to do for your birthday yet?"</p>

  <p>"Fly home," says my lover.</p>

  <p>"We’re here," I tell him. "It’s an adventure. How about visiting the cemetery?"</p>

  <p>"That would be romantic. I do enjoy a good graveyard." He swats an emerald fly from the rim of my glass with one hand as the other lifts his damp t-shirt from his chest.</p>

  <p>"We ought to go there sometime. It’s the biggest cemetery in the western hemisphere. The Book claims it’s got some really nice mausoleums." I reach for my drink and take a warm sip. "Art deco, it says."</p>

  <p>"Really? That might be worth the effort." </p>

  <p>Nigel’s love of art deco is almost as obsessive as my dreams of spiced food. I pull out the Book &ndash; a Rough Guide we bought cheaply back in London, due to its outdatedness &ndash; and solemnly hand it over. </p>

  <p>As he reads the entry my eyes wander across the square. The santeira woman must have arrived while we were talking; she’s an iyalorisha according to our friend the waiter, a sort of voodoo priestess, though she doesn’t look voodoo to me. Her bleached linen-frilled frock, buttoned to her neck and reaching down past her knees, contrasts strongly with her wide, red belt and her deep, blue-flint skin. She sits on her usual step in front of the cathedral’s wooden doors, unconcerned by the sun’s heavy weight of heat, and puffs on a cigar as almost as thick and long as our neighbour’s candle. She scares me, that woman: I can tell she knows I’m staring at her, and when she returns my gaze I look away quickly, a sudden knot of confusion forming as if by magic in my stomach.</p>

  <p>"We could go on a trip somewhere," I suggest.</p>

  <p>"Where to?"</p>

  <p>"Out of the city. We could book something with Alberto."</p>

  <p>"I suppose so," says Nigel, still reading. From across the square I hear the over-familiar opening bars of Guantanamera &ndash; the signal to warn the square’s workers of the imminent arrival of a tour party.</p>

  <p>They walk in couples and huddles, immense chicks trailing their diminutive hen of a guide, her parasol-grasped hand-high above her head. Their patterned shirts and saggy rucksacks, their strawberry burned skin &ndash; their wrist bands &ndash; suggest day-trippers from the north coast resorts. The guide calls assertively in French then German, or possibly Dutch given the number of times she clears her throat. She leads them past our table &ndash; ‘Bonjour’, ‘Hallo’ &ndash; towards the cathedral where they semi-circle her, surreptitiously snapping their cameras at the santeira woman still sat on her step.</p>

  <p>"You want to be like them?" asks Nigel, draining the dregs of his tea.</p>

  <p>"You want to stay in Havana for another ten days?"</p>

  <p>He shakes his head, setting a drizzle of sweat to trickle down from his shorn head.</p>

  <p>"So we’ll go-see Alberto, see what he has to offer."</p>

  <p>The club sandwiches arrive just as the shadow’s edge reaches my leg.</p>

  <hr />

  <p>It takes us half an hour to walk to the hotel where Alberto keeps his office; we manage the journey without a map and only a couple of wrong turns. Away from the crumbling slums, keeping to the ribbons of renovation that snake through the old quarter, Havana is gorgeous: as if Hemingway never left and Castro never landed his yacht in Oriente. Where cars are allowed, they are tourist vintage &ndash; the abandoned scraps of America’s gangster-bankrolled love affair with its pet island nation, lovingly restored and maintained as luxury taxis.</p>

  <p>For the most part, though, these streets are the home of the tourists, the guards, the loiterers and their neighbours. At one point a man rides past us on a bicycle sporting Chinese glyphs on its frame, ringing his bell wildly as he steers with one hand; the other hand supporting an eight-inch square paving slab of cake, garish in pink and lime green icing &ndash; a birthday gift from the State to one of its screaming children, so Alberto tells us when we ask him.</p>

  <p>The policemen, one to each junction, do a good job keeping the loiterers at bay; only twice during our journey are we offered cheap cigars. The second entrepreneur is young, almost old enough to join his crossroads comrades and carry his own weapon, and also more intelligent: he offers to rent us his brother for an hour. I'm tempted to ask if he could do us a similar deal for his father, slumped in the shade of an acacia nursing a coffee, but the lad is already slipping back into the shade as the closest guard turns his idle stare in our direction.</p>

  <hr />

  <p>"This isn't the real Cuba," explains Alberto. "This is all honey to draw cash from your wallets. Yet the real Cuba is still here, even in these Disney streets. But you won't see it if you keep looking with English eyes."</p>

  <p>We've been evicted from the hotel lobby where our tour guide keeps his desk by a gang of masked fumigators. They wear silver cannisters on their backs with hoses like fire extinguishers, though the smoke they produce is as choking as any fire.</p>

  <p>"See, these men are not really here."</p>

  <p>"Then what are they doing here?" asks Nigel, intrigued.</p>

  <p>"They are not here because they are not killing mosquitoes that most definitely do not carry dengue fever." He smiles at my partner's confusion, the wide teeth breaking his thin, close-shaven face into two halves. "But if you really want to know, then maybe I can say these men are working hard as part of the renovation effort to maintain the evident beauty of our capital, yes?"</p>

  <p>I consider his proposition, forcing myself to ignore the sting of smoke in my eyes. "Should I worry that I might catch a bout of renovation?"</p>

  <p>"It is a small risk. A careful traveller always carry plenty of mosquito spray."</p>

  <p>We talk as we watch the workers. Alberto knows the details of the trips our tour operator offers by heart, and offers us a variety to choose from. As it's Nigel's birthday, he gets to make the decisions: eventually he settles on an overnight visit to Trinidad &ndash; the furthest we can reach from Havana without having to take to the air. We retreat to the cool foyer of a bank opposite the hotel to conclude the transactions; by the time we are done the fumigators are gone, though the acrid sting of their regeneration work remains. </p>

  <p>To celebrate, we go to the hotel's bar &ndash; yes, Alberto tells us, Hemmingway most certainly drank here; he drank everywhere but his favourite hotel was a couple of streets away and he much preferred to eat in La Bodeguita Del Medio just around the corner from where we're staying.</p>

  <p>"Is the food as good now?" I ask, remembering my quest to uncover some taste in the island's cuisine.</p>

  <p>"Of course! The restaurant attracts many tourists: everybody signs the walls after they have eaten, it is a tradition. The rice and peas served there is very good."</p>

  <p>"Perhaps we should stop eating with English tongues?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," says Alberto. "Look beyond the signed walls, sniff between the rubbish heaps. Taste the rice and peas with a new tongue. You will find Cuba, if you let Cuba find you."</p>

  <hr />

  <p>We make it back to our apartment before the daylight fails. As we open the door a blanket of trapped, baked air rolls over us. The room itself is in darkness, the shutters closed by the maid who cleaned our floors and twisted our towels into the shapes of swans. I know she does it because she hopes to earn a large tip from our wallets, but this evening I don't begrudge her efforts. I must accept the fact that I am a tourist, still searching for a better pair of eyes.</p>

  <p>Nigel heads to the bathroom and his beloved toothbrush while I throw open the wooden shutters to wave at my neighbour.</p>

  <p>"Hey, Nigel! She's moved!" The huge catholic candle is lit, but the chair has lost its occupant. </p>

  <p>Below me I can hear Spanish voices, arguments and instructions; a whistle of tune as a man my age drags a log to the centre of the path. A liberated railway sleeper is already in place, and a great oil drum, and kindling. By a half-broken door I spot my woman: she's telling the man what to do, mostly by finger point and head nods.</p>

  <p><i>"Buenos tardes,"</i> I call down to her.</p>

  <p><i>"Tardes,"</i> she replies, her smile a golden sunset.</p>
