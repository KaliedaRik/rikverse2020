<p>I wake, dead. Five foot six <br />
and three quarter inches of rage.<br />
Tunnels take me to the light, to love.<br />
In trust, I am judged, reviewed. I remain <br />
rage. Take the long leap back<br />
to my corpse.</p>

<p>I stare at the stiffening smile. <br />
Choose a future<br />
as the rictus sets my face.</p>

<p>Landfill is the familiar fate.<br />
I would lie man-long in my grave. Rot.<br />
Interlink my limbs, my ribs, with yew roots.<br />
Hear hoar frosts crack across my tomb,<br />
etch my epitaph clean from<br />
its stone page.</p>

<p>Incineration, then. A dignified exit<br />
into the flame, curling<br />
the bones before the marrow cracks.</p>

<p>Neither option offers peace.<br />
Sustainable waste management requires<br />
the eastern means &ndash; recycle dead flesh<br />
atop the silent towers, watch vultures<br />
pick at the carcass before bones slide<br />
down roof tiles to shatter<br />
in the pit.</p>

<p>Though vultures are rare, here<br />
in the Isle of Angels. Dogs<br />
are no substitute, and lack wings.</p>

<p>Higher, then. Re-use. Let surgeons<br />
take their steel and slice my cooling flesh<br />
to liberate my offal: kidneys, corneas.<br />
My heart and my lung. I shall live in others,<br />
leaving my cast-iron stomach on a pedestal<br />
at my memorial, its lining scraped<br />
into milk: mourners shall feast<br />
on my junket.</p>

<p>This too I reject. I must be more in death<br />
than in life. I shall minimise waste.<br />
Reduce. Become the pinnacle of sustainability.</p>

<p>I will keep my dead flesh<br />
strung to my frame. I will claim<br />
the eternal flame, sign Faust's forms,<br />
take a Dutch mariner's gamble. Borrow<br />
Baron Samedi's hat. Unlive. Desert the day.<br />
Suckle upon the dark side of the force.<br />
Become Unfree.</p>
