<p>I wake, dead. Five foot six <br />
and three quarter inches of rage. <br />
Tunnels take me to the light, to love. <br />
In trust, I am judged, reviewed. I remain <br />
rage. Take the long leap back <br />
to my corpse. </p>

<p>I stare at the stiffening smile. <br />
Choose a future <br />
as the rictus sets my face. </p>

<p>Landfill is the familiar fate. <br />
I would lie man-long in my grave. Rot. <br />
Interlink my limbs, my ribs, with yew roots. <br />
Hear hoar frosts crack across my tomb, <br />
etch my epitaph clean from <br />
its stone page. </p>

<p>Incineration, then. A dignified exit <br />
into the flame, curling <br />
the bones before the marrow cracks. </p>

<p>Neither option offers peace. <br />
Sustainable waste management requires <br />
the eastern means &mdash; recycle dead flesh <br />
atop the silent towers, watch vultures <br />
pick at the carcass before bones slide <br />
down roof tiles to shatter <br />
in the pit. </p>

<p>Though vultures are rare, here <br />
in the Isle of Angels. Dogs <br />
are no substitute, and lack wings. </p>

<p>Higher, then. Re-use. Let surgeons <br />
take their steel and slice my cooling flesh <br />
to liberate my offal: kidneys, corneas. <br />
My heart and my lung. I shall live in others, <br />
leaving my cast-iron stomach on a pedestal <br />
at my memorial, its lining scraped <br />
into milk: mourners shall feast <br />
on my junket. </p>

<p>This too I reject. I must be more in death <br />
than in life. I shall minimise waste. <br />
Reduce. Become the pinnacle of sustainability. </p>

<p>I will keep my dead flesh <br />
strung to my frame. I will claim <br />
the eternal flame, sign Faust's forms, <br />
take a Dutch mariner's gamble. Borrow <br />
Baron Samedi's hat. Unlive. Desert the day. <br />
Suckle upon the dark side of the force. <br />
Become Unfree.</p>
