<h3>Update</h3>

<p>From June 2025, The RikVerse no longer uses, or cares about, cookies. This means that visitors can no longer share RikVerse poems to Facebook or that abomination that used to be called Twitter.</p>

<p>It also means that Rik looses his Big Blue <b>Donate</b> button. Rik can live with this because, over the course of running his own poetry website for over 20 years, Rik has received a grand total of 4 (four) donations - and none of them over $10. This is fine: Rik has a job and considers poetry (and writing novels) to be his <i>hobby</i> &ndash; it was never about the money.</p>
