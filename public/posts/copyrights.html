<p>After a long time of thinking and fretting, I decided that I was unhappy with the copyright arrangements for my poems. So, in July 2009 I decided to start using <a href='https://creativecommons.org/'>Creative Commons licences</a>.</p>

<p>As the CC folk say on their website: </p>

<p class='strophe-indented-with-italics'>"Creative Commons licenses are not an alternative to copyright. They work alongside copyright, so you can modify your copyright terms to best suit your needs. We’ve collaborated with intellectual property experts all around the world to ensure that our licenses work globally."</p>

<p>Which is why you’ll see copyright notices littered around various listings and pages across this website.</p>

<h3>What does all this mean?</h3>

<p>What I’m saying is, if you want to post one of my poems to your website or blog, go right ahead – as long as you remember to give me credit for the poem by making sure you say <i>"This poem was written by Rik Roots".</i> Feel free to take one of my poems into class for your ‘found poem’ project. You can reuse a poem, for instance in a leaflet or pamphlet – <b>as long as they’re not for sale!</b>.</p>

<p>And the best bit is you can do all this fun stuff with my poems without having to pay me! Check out the Creative Commons website for more information for what can and can’t be done to works released under a Creative Commons <a href='https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/'>Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International</a> licence.</p>

<p>If you do use my work, I’d be interested to hear about it. And, while the licence allows you to do fun stuff with my poems without having to pay me, a donation to help me keep on writing more poems is always very welcome – just click on the donate button at the top of this post.</p>

<p><b>Please note that this only extends to my poetry.</b> All my prose work is excluded from the Creative Common licences (even if I do give my novels and short stories away for free)</p>

<h3>But wait! There’s more!</h3>

<p>You know how you’re supposed to progress as a poet as time goes by? Well, I’ve been thinking about those poems I wrote more than 15 years ago and, well, I think it’s about time they started to make their own way in the world.</p>

<p>So I’ve decided to release the poems last edited more than 15 years ago under the much sexier Creative Commons <a href='https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/'>Attribution 4.0 International</a> licence, which means that for these poems I’m going to be brave and let people copy, distribute, display, and perform these works – and derivative works based upon them – as long as you mention my name somewhere where folks can spot it.</p>

<p>And yes, you can use these poems for commercial work. And no, I don’t expect to be paid – though again a donation is always welcome!</p>
