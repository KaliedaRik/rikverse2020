<p>Somebody somewhere posted a short note about the wierd concept of <i>publishing for prosterity</i>. Which got me thinking.</p>

<p>I mean, I can understand people's desire to publish their poems. While it's not a desire I share with them, I can understand that there is a poetry community out there, and that publishing poems is somehow related to a person's standing or worth in the eyes of that community. </p>

<p>Because poetry is, first and formost, a social construct and wherever you get social constructs you get hierarchies, and most people have a genetically driven need to climb as high as they possibly can within the hierarchies they associate with.</p>

<p>It's what I call The Great Game, and you're right in thinking I'm more of an audience than a competitor when it comes to playing.</p>

<p>But what's this "posterity" thingy that some people think is a good reason for poets to publish their work?</p>

<p>What is "posterity"?</p>

<p>Dictionary.com is succinct on the definition. Posterity is: </p>

<p class='strophe-indented-with-italics'>Future generations: 'Everything he writes is consigned to posterity' (Joyce Carol Oates)'</p>

<p>... There's no arguing with that definition.</p>

<p>But that means that I'm part of the posterity for all those poets who were publishing their poems down the centuries. I'm Shakespeare's posterity, Owen's posterity. Coleridge and Wordsworth wrote and published their poems for me. Whoever wrote down Beowulf and Gawain and Homer's Iliad did it for my benefit.</p>

<p>And what did I do to thank these wonderful people for their gift?</p>

<p>Well, at school I was made to sit down and dissect their poems. I cut open their strophes and rhymes and looked for the magic that (I was told) made them the best poems ever written. Some poems I was forced to memorise, some poems I was compelled to psychoanalyse by teachers who knew scarcely more about psychoanalysis than I did. </p>

<p>Over the course of 12 years of formal schooling I spent perhaps a month at most in the company of these gifts.</p>

<p>Not once was I told to go away and read these poems for the pleasure they could give me. At no time was it suggested to me that my time with these poems served any purpose apart from furthering my education and contributing to a scorecard at the end of the term, the year.</p>

<p>These poems left to me were products to be processed, assessed and discarded. That's posterity for you.</p>

<p>Fuck posterity!</p>
