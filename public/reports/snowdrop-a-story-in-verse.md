## Short Summary (Blurb) for Contemporary Poetry Readers

Rik Roots' Snowdrop: A Story in Verse, a verse novel drafted between 2004 and 2012, plunges the reader into a Christmas that quickly devolves from festive joy into a chilling odyssey of fear and loss. The narrative unfolds across 79 poems, organized into 14 distinct sections, primarily set on the ancient, mist-shrouded Romney Marshes and the mysterious Lym Hill. This chapbook unravels the tale of a young girl, "Snowdrop," whose seemingly ordinary Christmas visit to her Gran's cottage  in the 1980s  morphs into an unsettling encounter with a pagan, timeless realm. The poem navigates themes of displacement, the collision of ancient folklore with contemporary reality, and a protagonist's struggle for sanity amidst surreal transformations of landscape and perception. Through evocative imagery and a narrative that blurs the lines between dream and waking, Snowdrop explores the enduring power of myth and the psychological impact of being caught between worlds, ultimately offering a poignant reflection on memory, identity, and the fluid nature of time and place.

## Academic Review: Key Themes, Critical Analysis, and Research Contributions

Snowdrop: A Story in Verse by Rik Roots, a verse novel meticulously drafted over an eight-year period (2004-2012), presents a compelling and formally intricate narrative poem. The action spans two distinct, undated Christmas celebrations, one in the 1980s and another in the 2000s, primarily within the evocative landscape of the Romney Marshes and Lympne Hill (referred to as Lym). The narrative centers on the protagonist, Snowdrop, as she is abruptly dislodged from her quotidian reality into "Time Everlastin'", a liminal space where traditional Christmas festivities are grotesquely transmuted into a pagan, pre-Christian landscape and ritual.

### Key Themes:

* **Liminality and Dislocation:** The poem expertly explores both physical and temporal liminality. Snowdrop's journey from a seemingly ordinary Christmas in Hythe  to the "timeless place of fear" on the Marshes  highlights a profound sense of dislocation. This is reinforced by the transformation of familiar landmarks, such as Stutfall Tower (the archaeological remains of the Roman port of Lemanis ) and a derelict church on Lympne Hill, from ruins to functional structures within "Time Everlastin'", unsettling the protagonist's perception of reality and time. The pervading "Glamour" further blurs the boundaries between the real and the supernatural.

* **Mythology and Folklore:** Roots meticulously weaves together disparate threads of English and broader European folklore. Characters such as Jack Flame (a local variant of Jack O'Lantern inspired by marsh lights ), Jenny Twig (a dryad spirit ), the Wild Hunt, and the Black Dog (the Shuck, originally from East Anglia ) are all integrated into the narrative, sometimes with deliberate deviations from their traditional depictions. The "hoodeners", a local Kentish mummery tradition, play a significant role, blurring the lines between theatrical performance and genuine ritual. The explicit references to Kipling's Puck of Pook's Hill  (including the phrase "Time Everlastin'" ) and Terry Pratchett's Hogfather  ground the work within a lineage of imaginative engagement with folklore.

* **The Nature of Time and Memory:** "Time Everlastin'" functions as a central conceit, where chronological progression is suspended or altered. Snowdrop's experience of days feeling like moments and the unsettling appearance of figures like the Napoleonic-era Lord's Corporal and Older Soldier  or Mistress May  who believe themselves long dead, raises fundamental questions about the linearity of time and the subjective nature of memory. The abrupt return to a radically altered modern world post-climax further emphasizes this temporal displacement.

* **Critique of Progress and Modernity:** The abrupt return to a contemporary, industrialized Romney Marsh, with its "wires on poles" and "horseless carts", presents a stark contrast to the timeless, wild "Time Everlastin'". This juxtaposes a romanticized, albeit dangerous, past with a present perceived as "despoiled" and alienating, implicitly critiquing the impact of modern development on landscape and community. The shift from sheep pasture to arable crops after WWII is explicitly noted.

* **Sacrifice and Renewal:** The narrative builds towards a ritualistic sacrifice, echoing ancient practices for appeasing deities and ensuring cyclical renewal. Snowdrop's unwitting role, stemming from her consumption of a "bean" which acts as the "secret key"  to "Time Everlastin'", positions her as a reluctant participant in this cycle. The tension between the Tallyman's ancient, violent renewal and Snowdrop's eventual subversion of it forms the core of the poem's climax.

### Critical Analysis and Research Contributions:

* **Intertextuality and Allusion:** The poem's rich intertextual fabric offers fertile ground for academic inquiry. Beyond the explicit references to Kipling and Pratchett, the inclusion of Latin passages from Lucretius's De Rerum Natura  (recited by the Roman Sailor ) invites analysis of how classical philosophical ideas of atomism and the nature of reality interact with the poem's supernatural elements. A close reading could explore how the perceived "slander"  of the modern landscape aligns with or diverges from Lucretius's materialist worldview.

* **Regionalism and Psychogeography:** Snowdrop offers a unique lens through which to explore the psychogeography of the Romney Marshes. The author's personal connection to the region and its history, including its infamous "ague" (malaria), permeates the narrative. Scholars of regional literature or place-based studies could analyze how the poem transforms a specific geographical area (Hythe, Lympne Hill, Romney Marshes ) into a powerful symbol of memory, loss, and enduring myth. The depiction of the "Shaking Lad"  and his fragmented memories of a different Marsh provides an intriguing exploration of how place is remembered and re-imagined.

* **The Fantastic in Contemporary Poetry:** The poem's seamless integration of the fantastic into a contemporary setting provides a case study for analyzing the resurgence of speculative elements in modern verse. How does Roots employ poetic devices to render the uncanny believable, and what does this contribute to broader discussions of magic realism or the weird in poetry? The unsettling visual imagery, such as Jenny Twig's grotesque blossoming  or the appearance of figures formed from mud and mist, merits further exploration.

* **Character Poetic Forms and Narrative Voice:** The metadata reveals a highly structured approach to character voice, with each speaking character adopting a particular poetic form (e.g., Snowdrop's loose sonnet, Gran's sonnet, the Smuggler's variable length strophes, the Lord's Corporal's "bastardised Psalms"). This formal constraint, alongside the Narrator's alliterative verse, presents a rich area for formalist analysis. Scholars could investigate how these distinct poetic forms contribute to characterization, theme, and the overall narrative coherence of the verse novel. The inclusion of "interlude," "portent," and "vision" poems further complicates and enriches the narrative structure.

* **Gender and Agency:** Snowdrop's journey begins as a seemingly passive victim, drawn into a supernatural conflict by the ingestion of a magical bean. However, her agency gradually increases, culminating in her destructive act against the Tallyman's cauldron. An academic analysis could trace this development of agency, particularly in relation to the patriarchal figures she encounters (the Tallyman, the Lord's Corporal ) and the archetypal female figures (Gran, Mistress May, the Queen ). The inclusion of Snowdrop's mother as a "Ghost"  further adds to the complex web of female relationships and influences within the narrative.

In conclusion, Snowdrop: A Story in Verse offers a compelling and complex poetic engagement with folklore, memory, and the enduring power of place. Its thematic depth, rich intertextuality (including direct Latin quotations ), and particularly its innovative and rigorous formal choices regarding character voices and narrative modes, make it a valuable text for scholarly examination across various disciplines within English literature, particularly for those interested in contemporary poetry's engagement with the fantastic, regional identity, and the intricate relationship between form and meaning.

- The action in the novel takes place just before two undated Christmas celebrations, one in the 1980s and the other in the 2000s

## Blurb
For most people, Christmas is a time of joy; for some it has become a time of lonely sorrow. For Snowdrop, Christmas is about to become a timeless place of fear, horror – and unimaginable loss. On the hill above the Marshes, someone watches; some thing waits …

## Geography
- Lympne Hill, called Lym in the verse novel: an ancient sea cliff at the south east edge of England
- The church on the hill: abandoned church ruins somewhere beyond the crest of Lympne Hill
- Romney Marshes: coastal marshland between Lympne Hill and the English Channel; drainage of the marshes to create agricultural land started during the Roman era; also known as "the gift of the sea" - see antiquarian writers like Barham, Camden, Ingoldsby
