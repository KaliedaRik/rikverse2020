    blurb: `<p>In <i>22 Facets of my Father</i>, Rik Roots embarks on a poignant and often unvarnished exploration of a father-son relationship, seen through a series of twenty-two thematically distinct poems. Each poem, titled after a Major Arcana tarot card, delves into a specific "facet" or memory, ranging from formative childhood moments to the complexities of adulthood and the enduring impact of a paternal figure.</p><p>Roots employs a direct, evocative style, weaving together mundane domestic scenes with profound emotional revelations, and grounding universal experiences of family dynamics within the distinctive landscape of the Romney Marsh in Kent. Readers interested in contemporary poetry that grapples with memory, identity, and the intricate bonds of family will find a compelling and deeply personal narrative here.</p>`,

    blurb: `<p>Rik Roots' <i>Play Time</i> offers a compelling inaugural collection, demonstrating an emergent poetic voice engaged with the textures of urban existence and interior landscapes. These early poems, spanning from adolescence to the turn of the century, reveal a poet at play with form and thematic exploration, deliberately eschewing a singular overarching theme in favour of a diverse engagement with human experience.</p><p>From the raw sensuality of "Appreciation" and the visceral grit of "Commuting" to the poignant urban alienation of "Daisy" and the complex explorations of self and connection in "Menses" and "Consent", Roots navigates a contemporary sensibility. The collection often grounds abstract emotion in concrete, sometimes stark, imagery, inviting readers to witness the poet's "experiments and approaches"  as he grapples with desire, loss, identity, and the relentless pulse of metropolitan life.</p>`,

    blurb: `<p>Rik Roots' <i>Snowdrop: A Story in Verse</i>, a verse novel drafted between 2004 and 2012, plunges the reader into a Christmas that quickly devolves from festive joy into a chilling odyssey of fear and loss. The narrative unfolds across 79 poems, organized into 14 distinct sections, primarily set on the ancient, mist-shrouded Romney Marshes and the mysterious Lym Hill.</p><p>This chapbook unravels the tale of a young girl, "Snowdrop," whose seemingly ordinary Christmas visit to her Gran's cottage  in the 1980s  morphs into an unsettling encounter with a pagan, timeless realm. The poem navigates themes of displacement, the collision of ancient folklore with contemporary reality, and a protagonist's struggle for sanity amidst surreal transformations of landscape and perception.</p><p>Through evocative imagery and a narrative that blurs the lines between dream and waking, Snowdrop explores the enduring power of myth and the psychological impact of being caught between worlds, ultimately offering a poignant reflection on memory, identity, and the fluid nature of time and place.</p>`,

This collection provides a nuanced and often sardonic commentary on what it means to "still breathe" in a world increasingly mediated and defined by digital presences and disquieting realities.</p>`,

Her journey of self-discovery intertwines with a burgeoning plague and a hidden rebellion among the Servants, led by figures like the enigmatic Story Keeper, Maeduul, and the fiercely independent Kebezzu.

    blurb: `<p><i>SpinTrap: The Lonely City</i> introduces Kal, an ancient consciousness, a "rider" inextricably linked to a mysterious artifact known as "the Band." Kal's existence is a cycle of inhabiting human "hosts", navigating the "Outer World" (our contemporary London) and retreating to one of several "stones" or alternate realities. Forced back into the modern world within the body of Sam, a young man grappling with profound grief after the suspicious deaths of his parents, Kal discovers that the fundamental rules governing the Band and the "render" process (exiting a host) have unpredictably shifted.</p><p>As Kal grapples with his diminishing control over Sam, who increasingly asserts his own awareness and fights against Kal's influence, he encounters a clandestine network of "riders" facing their own terror, a hidden sub-species of "vampires" who siphon human energy, and a shadowy organization known as "The Company" that seeks to exploit the Band's power. Roots crafts a compelling, multi-layered narrative that blends ancient mythology with gritty urban realism, probing themes of dislocated identity, the fluid nature of reality, and the unexpected challenges of navigating an evolving human landscape. The novel offers a stark, de-romanticized portrayal of immortality and the often-uncomfortable intimacy between consciousness and flesh.</p>`,

    publishdate: "2019-12-01",
    coverimage: "/images/cover-riks-army-career.webp",
    blurb: `<p><i>Rik's Army Career</i> offers a unique and disarmingly honest self-narration of a brief yet formative period of military service, specifically June to December 1988. Far from a typical heroic war memoir, Roots presents a granular, often sardonic, account of British Army basic training through the lens of a young man grappling with pre-existing personal eccentricities, emergent self-awareness, and the unexpected clash between his internal world and the rigid external demands of military life. The narrative is fragmented, reflecting the author's own "P Thing" (prosopagnosia)  and selective memory, as well as the disorienting nature of the training itself.</p><p>Readers will find a compelling exploration of identity formation under duress, the subversion of traditional masculinity through unexpected vulnerabilities (such as a fear of water), and the subtle, often absurd, humor found in regimented environments. Roots's prose is marked by its conversational tone, direct address to the reader, and a refreshing lack of romanticism concerning military life, offering instead a raw and unvarnished perspective on a personal "adventure holiday" that ultimately redefined his understanding of self and belonging.</p>`,
